With AI cut off from the Chaos net, I did C-X C-F OZ:<LMDOC>SYS87.MSG
and got host AI not responding when it tried to read in the file
FONTS;TR12 (TR12 is one of the fonts specified by OZ:<LMDOC>SYS87.MSG in
its attributes list).  Shouldn't there be a set of fonts on OZ, and if
there is shouldn't Zwei be smart enough to go look for them there?
(Although this machine has default host AI, OZ was given as the second
argument to Login.)  Fixed in the new error system?

ItWouldBeNiceIf c-0 c-x alt were to put before each line the argument
to c-x alt you need to give to get it.

ItWouldBeNiceIf a little more state could be saved for c-x alt.  In
particular, ItWouldBeNiceIf m-X Execute Command Into Buffer could save
the key typed as well as minibuffer stuff.

Is there no way to give a repetition count to c-Y?  This might be a
better use for a numeric argument thatn the current one, as the
current one can be done with m-Y anyway, and you (I) don't often
remeber the order of things in the kill buffer to be able to use the
current numeric argument anyway.

To: BUG-LISPM at MIT-MC

I made the suggestion  once before ages  ago and it  seems to have  been
ignored. I'll make it again since I think it's a good idea and it  might
have just been accidentally passed over...

Couldn't the  function  which sets  up  *Mail-n* buffers  mark  them  as
unmodified after putting in the

  To:
  Re:
  --Text follows this line--

so that if a person types Abort not having done anything in the  buffer,
it won't end up saving that buffer around as if it had something  useful
in it?  I  keep  finding  I  have lots  of  *Mail-n*  buffers  and  very
frequently they are the result of having  done C-X M instead of M-X  Bug
and I've just hit Abort to get out but ZWEI is dutifully preserving them
in case it thinks the contents are  of value when it could easily  catch
at least this simple case.

  Fixed in 87.17

It is a reasonable thing to do, but because of an important efficiency
bum in Zwei, it is always assumed that anything starting with a paren
in column zero is a top-level form.  This is even more true in system
87, where the compiler will correct parenthesization to indentation.

The moral is, grind your code the way Zmacs wants it ground, or you
will lose.

That's right, it's simulating the TECO feature.
As we all know, TECO is the standard for excellence
in editing user interface and naming.  It would be
awful to diverge from TECO, especially by calling
them something reasonable instead of 'Q-registers'
and giving them names instead of letters.

However, there is a bug.  With TECO I can name my
Q-registers .A, or even This is where I keep my
text, when using EMACS with TECO (heresy!).  If
we're going to emulate TECO, we shouldn't be
half-assed about it.

I've been playing with Undo.  I'm not yet sure how I like it, but...

Undo doesn't undo the modification of the buffer (which is what prompted it in the first

With small changes undoing off, you can undo yanks but not kills.  This strikes me as
counter-intuitive.  

UNDO-SMALL-CHANGES crashes regularly with bad array references, rplac'ing NIL, etc.  I
will try to make this reproducible.

Minor gripes:n

If you undo all changes to a buffer and do undo, it says ``nothing to undo YET'',
whereas ``nothing LEFT to undo'' would be more logical.  Unless you really think of undo
as taking you back in time.

    When using dired on an oz directory with protection set to all 7's,
    dired bombs when I type # $ or attempt to alter file attributes other
    than @. The . commands bombs alot too, sometimes saying I need wheel or
    operator capability.
These seem to be bugs in the TOPS-20 file server running on OZ.
Whenever I try to do a CHANGE-PROPERTIES the file server disappears.

    Dired should handle commands unavailable on a host better than bombing.
    Perhaps, dired could turn-on your wheel bit and do the right thing.
There is currently no ENABLE-CAPABILITIES file-server command, but there
should be.

CHANGE-PROPERTIES is dying??  I put a CHANGE-PROPERTIES command in the OZ
CFTP so I could send explicit C-P messages to see how the file server
coped, and it worked for what stuff I tested.  Is there some specific
thing it doesn't like?   Can you duplicate this?

I put support for ENABLE in the file server (for the message "ENABLE-

    (foo (bar) <point>)  [note space before point]

    c-Space c-m-B c-W c-U c-Y m-Space [what I have c-c-w bound to] =>

In Text Mode, Meta-A does not recognize the same point as a

spaces after the period that ends the previous sentence, Meta-A
will not recognize that as the beginning of the current

the beginning of the sentence for the express purpose of
removing the extra space!  M-E does recognize that point as the
end of a sentence.

Weird things were happening to me in fill mode.  First of all,
auto-fill was not agreeing M-Q about the fill column.  Auto fill
was often deciding to make the line shorter than M-Q was.
Things got weirder when I set a fill prefix of a TAB.  In this
case, it seemed to be subtracting the width of the TAB from the
right side, too.

Clearly something like this is a win.  Useful in the current form, but
probably we need a lot more users playing with it before it becomes
clear what exactly it should be doing.

I still think that a per-keystroke form of Undo that could be used in
place of rubout would be a win.  From a casual look at the
datastructures, it seems like this might be no more expensive than what
it does now?

Often I want to Undo the thing before the thing I just did.  Maybe a
numeric argument to c-h-U would be ``undo the nth last thing''.  c-0
c-h-U would display the last several things.  Or is this not well
defined?  I suppose a full TMS might get expensive.

c-N doesn't behave according to my intuitions when in the
wrapped-around part of a too-long line.  In particular, it goes
to the index in the next line that is the same as the index on
the too-long line, MODULO THE LINEWIDTH (so that it appears 
immediately below where it was before).  Moreover, it sets the
target index to that value, so if you do a c-P then, it goes
someplace near the begging of the previous line.  Thus, c-N c-P
is not a noop in this case.  Since there is no way currently to
undo a c-N except with a c-P, and since I often type one too may
c-N trying to get someplace and use c-P to recover, this is
confusing. 

I would rather c-N worked by BP-INDEXes rather than
BP-INDENTATIONs.  Looking at the code, it seems that this is
supposed to be a feature.  If so, an alternate version might be
nice.

Isn't it kind of random that package prefixes are printed out

Should anyone get bored and want to implement features, a system
whereby you could make up something like kbd macros, but with control
flow, would be a real win.  The ability to escape into TECO for this
is one of the real wins of EMACS over ZWEI.  Of course, the form of
the user interface is pretty unclear, and would need to be pretty well
thought through.  Brainstorming randomly with KMP, we thought that a
graphical flow-chart like editor might be a win, and that an escape
into raw lisp would be necessary.

Oh, probably because in those days I just blindly copied Emacs.  Your're
right, there should be such a command.  For now, you can get around the
lack by using "!" in Tags Query Replace, which you probably figured out
long ago...

Yes!  I have had trouble because of this, too.  It should do its
best to still offer to replace, in fact of the fact that the thing
to be replaced might not exist any more; if I have not edited it,
it's still there and I might still want to replace it (I often
do, in practice, when doing the analogous thing in Source Compare
Merge.)

This is not exactly one of those "get bored" things; a very smart friend
of mine, Daniel Halbert (DCH at MIT-ML, Halbert at PARC-MAXC) is trying
to do this as part of this PhD work.  I think that he would consider
your suggestion a bit too advanced for his user community (office
automation users, who are not programmers), but that's why it's a hard
problem.  Anyway, I forwarded your message to Dan.  Dan, by the way, did
a very good display-oriented Lisp debugger called DIDL as his MIT undergrad
thesis, which really worked (in Maclisp) and had a user community.  I think
it may still be on ML: DCH;.  It's not as hairy as the new Gregor/Henry ideas
but it was still very good.

You edit (with emacs or more primitive teco commands) your DIRED
buffer in EMACS in order to remove the entries whuch were included
that you didnt want to deal with, or to sort it in some strange way,
etc.  DIRED is sort of a recursive editing level.

Well, if I want to save a copy of a directory in a file, or if I want to
manipulate a bunch in some way, I edit out the files I don't want to
keep track of or use. It would be fine if there was a command which
un-write-only-ed the buffer.

I recently complained that it wouldn't let me do M-X Flush Lines.
I wanted to flush every line that had the word "Patch" in it so
I wouldn't have to look at them.

There is also the inverse operation, M-X Keep Lines, as in deleting
all files with the string "Patch" in them and similar operations.

Is someone already adding a command to make a buffer writtable, or
should I?

I don't want the job, there's too many crooks running around loose.

No, it's that ':READ-ONLY in the TICK slot of the node that does that.
I'll flush him if someone will tell me what the feature to turn him off
should look like.  Should it be on a key, or just M-X?  If there's also

Doing this is not quite as easy as you think...  I used to have a Read-only
mode, but gave up using it because:

   1)	Sticking ':READ-ONLY in the TICK slot is a kludge and causes you to
	lose the information that should be there.  You don't want the action
	of setting a buffer read-only to trash the "buffer modified" information.
	If you are going to use read-only for anything more than the hack that
	now is, I suggest that you give it it's own slot in an interval.
	
   2)	If you want file buffers to be initialized read only, you want it to
	happen in more places than just C-x C-f.  Indeed, you usually want it
	it most when M-.'ing system sources.  The logical place to make zwei
	check for a "read only default" is zwei:find-file.  Unfortunatly this
	loses HORRIBLY if you try to M-x Add Patch.  The result is that the
	patch directory gets written out with "patches in progress", but ZMacs
	completly forgets that it was in the process of making a patch.
	
   3)	There are a number of commands that don't respect ':READ-ONLY.
	M-x insert buffer or M-x insert file is one of them I think...

Yes, it does.  c-X c-Q makes a file/buffer be normal.  With a positive
argument, it "makes the file read-only", which means that if you try to
save it you get queried (this is the old Emacs Visit/Edit distinction,
which Zmacs does not generally deal with).  With a negative argument
it really makes the text read-only.  I suggest we implement this except
that any argument makes the text read-only.

As for whether the existing TICK = :READ-ONLY representation makes it
or not, I leave that to MMcM and RWK.

Add Patch really wants the function that creates a new buffer and complains

       1)	Sticking ':READ-ONLY in the TICK slot is a kludge and causes you to
	    lose the information that should be there.  You don't want the action
	    of setting a buffer read-only to trash the "buffer modified" information.
	    If you are going to use read-only for anything more than the hack that
	    now is, I suggest that you give it it's own slot in an interval.
This might be reasonable, but isn't necessary.  There's nothing which says
you have to throw away the old tick.  Certainly it's not worth changing how
this works in 218, (not easy at all!) but it might be worth adding another
instance variable in 219.  Mike?

You know, it ought to be possible to set the fill column in units of
characters as well as in units of pixels.  One typical reason to use
autofill mode is to keep the number of characters on a line down
(either for the sake of the less-fortunate who live on ascii CRTs, 
or in view of studies that show that reading is most efficient on lines 
about 60 characters long, regardless of size.)  If you are using several
fonts, a fill column set in pixels will screw this up.

When I do "Meta-X Apropos insert" "Self Insert" shows up twice.  Once
stating that it can by invoked by such useful keys as   (Front-'), 
(Top-H), but not listing "A", "B", etc.  The second mention of it says
that it is not on any key.  It would be nice if the key-bindings listed
the alphabetics (perhaps there should be a hook so that Apropos will
just print out a description of the class of keys that get bound to a
function).

Suggestion: Put Insert File on Control-X I.  The key is not used
otherwise, it is a common enough function, and it is compatible with
Multics Emacs.

Usually they then say that any expense would be worth not losing their

it; and they say that nothing involving Zwei internals is easy to
write.  Anyway, since it is trivial, what about defining it, so people

me that the Buffer should retain the fact that I had particular

Generally I like to open up a DIRED buffer and leave it open for an
entire editing session because it gives me a "menu" of files that I can
just point at and then read in with the E command.  I then periodically
update the display by reverting the buffer to reflect the current state
of the directory tree.  It is difficult to use this mode when Revert
Buffer forces me to rebuild the tree every time.

If we did this, then the Zmacs minibuffer would look like the Zmail
minibuffer, in that there would be a row of white pixels between it and
the border of the frame.  At least, if we did this in the obvious way,
that would happen.  Would you call this side-effect good, bad, or

There's no easy way to "try it out", but you can just look at Zmail.
Enter Zmail and type Meta-X.  That's what Zmacs frames would look like
it we added the pixel of white space.

This is the fifth time I've tried to send this.  You'll probably never
hear about the four bugs I had the other times...

By going into peek (bad user interface -- why isn't there a This Window
system menu item DEBUG?) I got this backtrace for the zmail problem.
This happens repeatedly 15% of the way through my mail file, which I
copied to <zvona.stuff>losing-mail._zmail_txt.

Why does c-M think it knows how many stack frames to include in the
report?  The last time I tried it, it was wrong.

Why is point put at the end of the text in a c-M, rather than at the
begginning?  This encourages people to put their text there, which is
presumably not where you want to see it.

Whatever is decided upon, Zmail, Zmacs, and Converse should look the same in
that portion of the frame.

I think the extra pixel of whitespace should be added to Zmacs, and the box
which pops up flushed altogether.  It was needed back in the days when the
frame border didn't extend to the bottom of the frame.  When you type Meta-X
to Zmail, the mode line should be replaced by "Command:" and a blinking cursor
should appear just below in the left margin.  The line which is always visible
above the mode line is enough to set the minibuffer apart from the rest of the
frame.

    Why isn't there a This Window system menu item DEBUG?
Because you don't debug windows, you debug processes.  However, the usual
try-to-find-a-process-for-this-window mechanism could be used.  I think
this would be a good thing; any opinions?

    Why does c-M think it knows how many stack frames to include in the
    report?  The last time I tried it, it was wrong.
Have you any suggestions as to how it could know?  A good heuristic would be
nice if anyone could suggest one.  Putting in all frames doesn't seem like
a good idea since there can be a LOT of frames under some circumstances.
We might want to just increase the number.

    Why is point put at the end of the text in a c-M, rather than at the

Yes, this is scheduled to be fixed, along with a prompt asking the user
to report what was going on when the bug came up.

    I think the extra pixel of whitespace should be added to Zmacs, and the box
    which pops up flushed altogether.  It was needed back in the days when the
    frame border didn't extend to the bottom of the frame.  When you type Meta-X
    to Zmail, the mode line should be replaced by "Command:" and a blinking cursor
    should appear just below in the left margin.  The line which is always visible
    above the mode line is enough to set the minibuffer apart from the rest of the
    frame.

Actually, looking at ZMAIL, I'm not convinced that it does have an extra pixel of
whitespace (we're talking about before ``Command:'', right? [NB: why does zmacs say
``extended command'' and zmail ``command''?  Both are extended in exactly the same way
it seems to me.  [I notice now that c-m-x in zmacs gives ``command:''.  What is the
rationalization of this?]])

Anyway, I like CWH's proposal.  However, I've argued before that the typeout window or
echoe area or whatever the thing that overlaps with the minibuffer is called,
shouldn't.  If this suggestion were adopted, a line might want to be put between the
two.

This barfed because of Disk quota exceeded when it should have

and then resumed the file operation.

According to ZWEI, the file I thought was being written out was
written out.  In fact, it wrote out the file with the name of
the other buffer.

  I frequently try to read in a file with a pathname wildly different
from the pathname of the current buffer, but make a mistake in
typing the new pathname.  When I try the second time, is there
anyway to reclaim what I have just erroneously typed.  Completion
seems to complete to the old pathname.

there is code that grabs a buffer with zwei:find-buffer-named and 
then does (setf (zwei:buffer-package buffer) (pkg-find-package "dpl"))
to set its package.  (The first line dpl writes to the buffer is
;;; -*- ... package:dpl ... -*-.)  Unfortunately, this method of
setting the package is guaranteed to lose every time the buffer
structure is changed.

    When you do View Directory of an unknown directory, you get a notification

I fixed this in the source a while ago.

Well, you can wholesale turn off all occurences of that question, by setting
the variable zwei:*set-attrbute-updates-list* to T (it always updates the
list) or NIL (it never updates the list) instead of its default value of :ASK.
This might help with your problem.  Otherwise I don't know any solution.

buffer in the rubout handler even thought that's not compatable.

Anyone want to put in there two bits as to what this key should do?

What do people think that the <Quote> key should do in general

Great for ZWEI, but what should they do elsewhere?  It probably 
would be a win for quote in an input stream to insert the next 
character into the buffer, with all of its bucky bits.  That's
the same thing in zwei, except that it doesn't exactly do
a control-q.  

Now I suppose that Macro in ZWEI should do a ^X ( if you
are not typing in a kbd-macro and ^X ) if you are.
I suppose if you're in a macro already you could type
control-macro to recursively define a kbd-macro.

1)  Maybe its random, but the keys must have been put on the lisp machine
for nothing.  Someone must have thought of something to use them for.
If its since been decided that those reasons are bad, then I'd be
interesting in knowing what those reasons are.   If you never use those
keys now (and I kinda doubt that you do), I don't see anything wrong
with making them do something, also long as it can't screw you.
I appreciate your concern for thinking that I'm wasting my time.
I think thinking is frequently more useful than doing for me, as
others seem to be able to DO better.

2)  I'm sorry if its not, but I remember  being told (cent, rms?) that 
info-lispm was where you ask people about what they think about making
some (perhaps major) change.  [Like terminal-v]  If I'm wrong, I'd like to know

"Delete" is the mnemonic for cntl-D in emacs, and it would make sense
for the delete key to perform the same function. The quote key should
quote the next character.

However, I'm sure every heavy user of lispms has his own bindings.
Expect much bitching no matter what is done.

Well, no, actually, the present behavior appears to be intentional.

    m-X Delete File
    foo.quux
    Delete OZ:<ZVONA>FOO.QUUX? (Y or N) Yes.
    Error: file does not exist.

    If it is going to give you that error, it should be before and not after

I agree with you.  The existing code seems to take the attitude that if the
file isn't found, well, you might know what you're doing anyway and it should
still try to delete it.  Note that before attempting to delete, it opens the
file to get the truename so that you can confirm; if this probing doesn't find
the file, it still offers to let you try to go ahead with the delete (notice
above, in your example that's not a truename since it has no version!) since
you might want to delete it even though the probe failed for some reason.
Unless there's a good reason for this that I don't know, it seems silly to me.

In ZWEI in Remote-File 19.1, LMFILE-Remote 21.2, MIT-Specific 14.0,
System 89.48, ZMail 47.13, microcode 187, hit me, on Ford Prefect:

Since there is no ZWEI extension-writer's manual, I have to assume that
any function I find in the sources is fair game for me to use.  Well, I
have been losing pretty badly lately, trying to write ZWEI extensions.
There are several gratuitous incompatibilities between the MIT system
and Symbolics system (I use 218); I often switch between the two
depending on what I plan to do and what kind of mood I am in (i.e., 89
has [Network] O, while 218 manages to find my Multics init file), so I
would like my personalizations to work in either system.  I realize that
I can conditionalize on the system, however I think that my gripe is
legitimate.

One case that I hit was the macro ZWEI:WITH-REGION-OR-WHOLE-BUFFER (as
it is called in 89), which is called ZWEI:WITH-QUERY-REPLACE-INTERVAL in
218.  I am not going to argue over which name is "better"; however, when
you make a gratuitous, incompatible change like this, it would be nice
if you would DEFF the old name so that things don't break, especially
since you don't mention these kinds of changes in the release notes.

Another change is even worse.  Sometime between versions 218 and 222 of
OZ:SRC:<L.ZWEI>COMTAB.LISP the function ZWEI:CREATE-COMTAB was changed
to take an argument.  This argument is also not in the system 218
version of the function.  The addition of this argument seems to go
along with the addition of a NAME component in the COMTAB structure; the
addition of the component is fine (that is what defstruct is for!), but
incompatibly changing what looks like the function that everyone who
wants to make a comtab should be calling (in my case, I am implementing
another prefix key) is irresponsible.

If I shouldn't be calling these things, tell me, and tell me how I am
supposed to know the difference.

confused, supplying an assumed close-paren on the "and" line.  Why isn't
the region just being given to the compiler as a stream, instead of
trying to second-guess me?  What is the right way for me to do this?  I
figured that the deff form had to start in column 1 so that
sectionization would find it if I did Meta-., and I fealt pretty safe
when Control-Meta-H marked the whole form when point was inside the deff
form.

The doc string for Select All Buffers As Tags Table does

Why are these things called tags tables, anyway?  This seems
like a hang-over from something or other.  The luser interface 
on them is pretty weird, too.  For example, Add/Remove Buffer 
to/from Tags Table would be very useful.

What about renaming them ``Buffer sets'' or ``Function spaces''

done on them.

Meanwhile, using MEDFNT, the buffer-editor buffer is much too wide

Why?  What should happen when you then do find file of the corresponding

I did a Find File In Fundamental Mode of a file with a bogus package in
the attribute list.  I vaguely thought that that command was supposed to
suppress package lossage, but probably I was confused.  Anyway, while
making the file buffer object it complained that package mumble didn't
exist and erred out.  OK.  I proceded by supplying a different package
name.  Then a moment later, it barfed again, in revert-from-stream.
This time it had an FQUERY interface with obscure options.  I don't like
the FQUERY interface, but the real bug is that it barfed twice.

the default arg to com-make-/(/)-backward is still 0 rather than 1 as in 210.  Is this
intentional or is it thoughtless?  I realize that symmetry would dictate this change, but
there are other considerations.  The reason that it is right for the default to be 1 is that
it does the same thing as com-make-/(/) with an argument of 0.  And it has a useful function
with an arg of 1, which is that often you forget to type an open before starting in on a
symbol, and this lets you patch up in one keystroke (instead of m-b c-1 m-( m-f).

I suspect I am the only user of this command.  But I'll advise it or something if you don't
make this change.

No, you jumped to soon.  Probably the average message that you will
find inside a send in user code is defined in only one place.  In
this case meta-. could jump right there.  Otherwise it can give you a
list of the possible flavors and let you pick.  There is already an
editor command that does something like this.  Having it invoked by
meta-. would save some typing and lend more consistency to the user

I don't believe this, even ignoring that sends in user code send
system-defined messages.

    list of the possible flavors and let you pick.  There is already an

Yes.  c-sh-A.  It is almost too slow to use.  I wish it would offer your
choice of flavors as you suggest, though, because a single message is
sometimes used in more than one protocol (and sometimes a message can
sometimes take an argument).
						   Having it invoked by
    meta-. would save some typing and lend more consistency to the user
    interface.
In a way, it's an inconsistancy, since one might expect m-. to find SEND.
But I've certainly wished for the feature often enough.

Some of the functions in ZWEI that manipulate comtabs do not deal well
with sparse comtabs.  The ones I noticed were
SET-COMTAB-UPPERCASE-INDIRECTION and SET-COMTAB-CONTROL-INDIRECTION.  In
the case of SET-COMTAB-UPPERCASE-INDIRECTION, it hardly makes sense for
the resulting comtab to be sparse, so it could make life easy on itself
and convert the comtab to an array first.

SET-COMTAB-UPPERCASE-INDIRECTION should not replace defined keys with
indirections.  I might even suggest that it should be smart, and if the
lowercase key has a definition while the uppercase one is undefined it
should move the definition to the uppercase and then make the
indirection, or perhaps it should just indirect the uppercase to the
lowercase.

    Meta-X View Register only shows you the first line of text- is this intentional?

Not really intentional; it's because it's sharing a subroutine with List
Regisers, which is trying to keep things brief enough that you can scan
over all the registers and see what's in them.  Since a register can
contain both a position and text, the position will have to be printed
first (instead of second, as it is now), or else if the contents of the
text in the register were very long you might not notice the position
at the end.  I'll fix this soon.

    I'd like a way to get at the whole thing. Also the documentation claims that
    the arg is read in a minibuffer, which it isn't.
Fixed in the source; most of the register commands said that.

I am in Lisp mode, with autofill on.  Sometimes autofilling works beautifully,
other times it gets confused.  This bug has existed for a long time -- here are
some examples:

1) I type a space at the end of an overflowing line of lisp code, at the end of
the buffer, and everything works fine, the overflowing code is indented
properly, and put on the next line:

(THIS IS SOME CODE FOO THIS IS SOME CODE FOO THIS IS SOME CODE FOO THIS IS SOME CODE FOO
==>
(THIS IS SOME CODE FOO THIS IS SOME CODE FOO THIS IS SOME CODE FOO THIS IS
      SOME CODE FOO

2) If one is not at the end of the buffer, and the next line is blank, a space
at the end of an overflowing line gets you a new line, but no indentation:

(THIS IS SOME CODE FOO THIS IS SOME CODE FOO THIS IS SOME CODE FOO THIS IS SOME CODE FOO
==>
(THIS IS SOME CODE FOO THIS IS SOME CODE FOO THIS IS SOME CODE FOO THIS IS SOME
CODE FOO 

3) I type a space at the end of an overflowing line, with a comment on the next
line; the code is inserted at the beginning of the next line, with a space
between it and the comment:

(THIS IS SOME CODE FOO THIS IS SOME CODE FOO THIS IS SOME CODE FOO THIS IS SOME CODE FOO
;;; this is a comment
==>
(THIS IS SOME CODE FOO THIS IS SOME CODE FOO THIS IS SOME CODE FOO THIS IS SOME
CODE FOO ;;; this is a comment

4) I type a space at the end of an overflowing line of code, with indented code
on the next line.  The code I've been typing gets the same indentation as the
code on the next line (which is almost always the wrong amount), and the code
on the next line is tacked on the end of the line, where it certainly doesn't
belong:

(defun some-function-with-long-hairily-named-args (long-hairy-named-arg1 long-hairy-named-arg2
  (let ((there be-some-code-on-the-next-line))
    ...

(defun some-function-with-long-hairily-named-args (long-hairy-named-arg1
  long-hairy-named-arg2 (let ((there be-some-code-on-the-next-line))
    ...

I would like it to always create a new line if there's text on the next one,
pushing the next line down, and indenting the code on the new line properly.

    I am in Lisp mode, with autofill on.  Sometimes autofilling works beautifully,
    other times it gets confused.  This bug has existed for a long time -- here are
    some examples:
I checked all your examples against our software, which seems to
do the right thing for all of them.

I thought to try a couple more examples you might like to try in
the other system.  First one that doesn't do quite the right thing in
our system:

For this one, once I started typing the "LKJ"'s, I went M-B'd back over
two of them, and started inserting more from there.  The first time
things lined up ok, because it did a CR before I typed the space or
something (I wasn't looking closely enough to be sure, and can't
reproduce it.)  The second line, I watched more carefully, and it broke
the KLJ's off the end of the line one at a time.  When I got to the end
of the line, the space moved me to the begining of the next line, before
the LKJ's that had already been moved, and I typed some more LKJ's.  It
would seem in this case it should have been moving the LJK's to just
before the previous ones and doing a Indent for Lisp each time,
including when it moved the cursor to the next line.

(THIS IS A LONG LIST FOO BAR SDLKJ LKJ LKJ LKJ LKJ LKJ LKJ LKJ LKJ LKJ
 LKJ LKJ LKJ LKJ LKJ LKJ LKJ LKJ LKJ LKJ LKJ LKJ LKJ LKJ LKJ LKJ LKJ LKJ
LKJ LKJ LKJ LKJ LKJ LKJ LKJ LKJ LKJ LKJ LKJ LKJ  

;;; This is a long comment that will overflow the line; let's see if it
;;; does the right thing... (seems to have, I guess that's fixed too..).
;;;  Well, not QUITE the right thing when it breaks on the second space
;;;  between sentences...  It's contagious, too, but I guess that's the
;;;  right thing...

Also, I find auto-fill useless for typing straight text, because I have
my own built-in autofill that competes with the ZWEI autofill.  I
typically type RETURN, which autofills and leaves me on a line after a
short stub line, since it filled, then did RETURN.  I.e. something like
this
line in the middle of this sentence.  (Neat self-reference, eh?)  In my
EMACS environment of old, I had my own macro on RETURN which EITHER
auto-filled or did a newline, but not both.  I found it did the right
thing much more of the time.  The price paid was that sometimes when
breaking paragraphs by typing TWO returns, you'd just get one.  I though
about fixing that by specially noticing two consequtive RETURNs and
putting in an extra in that case, but I don't remember if I did it, or
what the results were.

The alternative would be to make RETURN *NEVER* autofill.  I would
prefer that to the current behaviour, since my autofill mechanism
aproximates
the right thing, with some lines slightly over, while combining them
requires
I do manual fixing most of the time when I type RETURN.  But I think we
can
come up with a behaviour which almost always produces what the user
wants.  After all, micro do it, don't they?

By the way, I have always considered it a serious bug that the fill
column (and the comment column) are not per-buffer variables.  Since
90% of the files in the world use the default, when you change it for
one buffer, you always regret it later.

*** Wilder ideas ***

(DEFUN FOO (BAR ASLKFJ SLKDJF LSDKJF SLKDFJ SLDKJF SLDKFJSLKDJF)
  (COND ((SDFKLJ) (ASDLKFJ ASDLKFJ ASDLKFJ ASDLFKJASD FLKJ)	;This

						;maybe doing it right
						;requires knowing about
						;things like COND
						;clauses, etc.
	 (ASDLKFJASLDKJFALKSDJF))
	((ASDKLFJ) SDLKFJ)))

Also, it would seem that Lisp mode autofill could be a bit more clever
in general, and could be actually useful.  For example, attempting to
fill code to be too far to the right, and knowing some of the various
tricks like moving something several lines up into either a vertical
style or an un-indented style (LET style).  Making it fill comments to
a different fill column than code.  Making code auto-filling be willing
to extend past the nominal code fill column to avoid some of the grosser
over-verticalizations.

I think this is a not-too-difficult project for someone wanting to break
into user-interface type stuff, someone without a lot of low-level
expertise but ready for a moderate-sized developmental project.  Dan,
is this something you want to add to one of your ideas-list, or should
I just hang onto it as a private fantasy?

It's hard to believe the debugger really sends read-bp messages.  The grinder
uses those if given some argument telling it to.  It would be really interesting

The general idea of the "type rubout to correct" is so that if you make a
typographical error while READ is running, you can correct it, instead
of having the deugger entered.  Typeically this happens if you type an\
invalid package name, or type a colon where you didn't mean to.
However, it does indeed have the bad effect that it's harder to report
bugs in the rubout handler or reader; you have to set dbg:trace-conditions
to t and then try to get the problem to happen again.

Perhaps the error-catching stuff could be limited to certain classes
of errors, like sys:read-error or something?  This
sounds like a job for the new error system...

Yes, I agree it would be a good idea to limit the

known to be relatively safe, like mistyping package names, etc.

Subject: eval into buffer improvement?

222.  I often do m-X Execute Command Into Buffer m-alt because I want
to get the standard-output printed by evalling a form into the buffer.
Is there a less kludgy way of doing this?  If not, perhaps either a
new command should do it, or m-X Eval Into Buffer could do it.

m-X Eval into Buffer already does this when given an argument.
Its self documentation correctly reflects this fact.

Actually, this is a somewhat peculiar case.  Apparently what happened is
that somebody at some point went around fixing up names of editor
commands, and changed Occur to List Matching Lines (which is indeed a
better name, particularly if you use Apropos), kept the name Occur (by
making a command that just calls com-list-matching-lines), and copied
the same unclear documentation onto both commands.

I would also rather have it list all the lines.  I always have to go to
the beginning of the buffer before using Occur.  Perhaps the Emacs Occur
was originally defined to only go forward to be analogous with "Search"
commands or something, but I think this was misguided.

I wouldn't want to add a new command; after all, what would you call it?
Giving this command an argument seems to be the right thing to do.  It's
unfortunate that right now, an "argument" means a weird prefix numeric
code; we hope to fix this in general.  At that time, I'd like to change
the default, and have a "forward" option that makes it only look forward.

Emacs renamed Occur to List Match Lines a couple of years ago (both
names still work in Emacs), so clearly these are not intended to be
different commands.  It seems to me that the problem is simply that
like most of the on-line documentation in Zwei, it was not written
clearly (in this case, there is just a word missing, isn't there?)

I know that Emacs intended them to be the same command.  However, (a)
I'd like to have a command that's like it but starts at the beginning of
the buffer, and (b) I'd rather not have to do that by giving Occur/List
Matching Lines a numeric arg.  Do you think that starting at point is
actually more desirable, or are you saying that back-compatibility
and/or Emacs-compatibility is more important than having things be the
best way in this case?  I don't feel strongly about any of this; I've
just noticed that the way Emacs has set things up doesn't seem to be

Unfortunately, List Matching Lines already takes a neumeric argument.
If given a positive numeric argument it means to only list the next N
occurrences.  I don't recall what a zero argument means, but I seem to
recall it meaning something.

My message was only intended to say that it was no accident that m-x Occur
and m-x List Matching Lines have the same incorrect self-documentation,
since they are the same command; the name change evidently was following
the lead of Emacs.

I don't have an opinion whether it is better to leave it searching from
point for Emacs compatibility or to make it search from the beginning
because that is obviously what any user would expect.  Since they aren't
compatible in their treatment of the numeric arg anyway...draw your own
conclusions.

    A string with a <CR> and where the second line contains a 
    parenthesis in the first column confuses ZWEI. It seems
    to think it is still in string mode after the
    string has been closed.

The editor assumes any left parenthesis in the first column is
the beginning of a Lisp form.  If you think about it, you can
see why this is necessary: if the editor had to be able to parse
absolutely anything, it could only do it by starting at the
very beginning of the buffer and parsing the entire file until
it reached the point of editing; the beginning of the buffer
is the only place that is absolutely guaranteed not to be inside
a string or vertical bars.  Doing this much parsing would make
the editor so slow that it would be useless.

You can easily disguise the open parenthesis by putting a slash
in front of it.

(It seems that someone asks about this at least once a month.
I don't know where it can be explained so that everyone will
know about it for all time in the future.)

While it is nice that ZWEI shows all the comments preceding a definition

the editing window is small, it is quite possible that the "defun" line
will be the only one left (I notice that it will punt comments in order

Also, if you get around this by doing the S commands in reverse order,
DIRED still gets confused -- it forgets that the second subdir is a
directory, so you can't use S on it again to get rid of the subdir
listing.

Finally, I think it would be more winning if the files in the
subdirectory were indented more than the name of the subdir itself.  As
it is, if you have a number of subdirs listed with no files from the
main directory in-between, the listing looks really ugly.

Please load patches, or better yet, rebuild Daedalus in
the Rel 4.0 band I brought over a few days ago.

There have been 52 patches made to System since patches
were last loaded in that band.

This is more than 50 patch versions behind.  Try copying a rel 4.0

    Subject: Strange buffer-name-reading behavior
    To: BUG-ZWEI at MIT-OZ

    In System 91.29 ...
    In Release 4 ...

    I have a buffer in my ZMacs, ZMACS.LISP PS:<L.ZWEI> OZ:, and perform the
    following sequence of operations:

    C-X B ZMACS<Altmode>	;=> ZMACS.LISP PS:<L.ZWEI> OZ:
    C-X B ZMACS<Return>	;selects it
    C-X B BUFFER-1		;go back somewhere else
    C-X H			;make a region
    C-X A ZMACS<Altmode>	;=> ZMACS.LISP PS:<L.ZWEI> OZ:
    C-X A ZMACS<Return>	;Creates new buffer ZMACS !

    Return is SUPPOSED to complete the buffer name.  When in C-X B, it does.
    But in C-X A, it loses!

c-X A (Append to Buffer), Source Compare Merge, and c-X 4 B are buffer-creating
commands and allow you to create a buffer with Return rather than control-Return.
These are the only editor commands (in R 4.0) that do this.  So that's why
c-x A differs from c-X B.

I'll let those who care more than me about this argue about whether c-X A
belongs in this class of commands or the other.

Addendum to previous message: "New buffer" in the editor "Split screen"
menu is the fourth command that will create new buffers with Return
rather than c-Return.  Certainly this is not wrong.

If you use C-X C-W to write out your buffer to a different file, but
abort out of it before it finishes, the buffer name is changed anyway.
I do not believe this is the right thing.

I have two buffers.  One is called "POTCAL.PALX.0 PS:<PUMA.SAIL> OZ:" (name
came from a tag table); the other is called "POTCAL.PALX PS:<PGS.PUMA> OZ:".

When I do C-X B and type "POTCAL.PALX" and then an altmode, it tries to
complete to one buffer or the other, apparently (I'm not sure about this) based
on which I last visited.  I would prefer that it not try to complete to either,
because the buffer name is still ambiguous at that point.

Typing Abort during Incremental Search leaves point at the new location
but does not set a mark at the original location (at least, it doesn't
say "Mark Set") the way Altmode does.  Intuitively, I also feel that
Abort should be equivalent to C-G, but I won't argue this point.
