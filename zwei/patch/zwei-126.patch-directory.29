  (1 "DIRED-PATHNAME-EQUAL doesn't blow up on arguments that aren't pathnames.
Also, it coerces strings into pathnames." "saz" NIL)
  (2 "DIRED.LISP modified extensively -- here are the major changes:

DIRED-PATHNAME-EQUAL accepts more types of arguments;
COM-DIRED-SUBDIRECTORY has added functionality for 
  inserting and removing subdirectory contents from a 
  Dired display;
New command `>' introduced, which moves cursor to 
  most recent version of current file;
HELP documentation updated and reformatted 
  so as to arrive in semantic screenfuls;
DIRED-PROCESS-FILES now makes sure that it has
  a file to process before doing anything.

  (3 "Fix logic in ED and ZWEI:EDIT-THING.  Prevents an error in cold load
stream caused by datatype error in STRING-EQUAL.

  - Keith and SAZ" "keith" NIL 2797883598)
  (4 "Zwei now implements a new alist mechanism for remembering
user-defined keyboard macros.  Upon completion of a keyboard
macro at any macro level, via Meta-X End Keyboard Macro or
its equivalent, control-x ) , the user is now asked to supply
a name for the macro.  If they wish to leave it unnamed
(\"temporary\"), typing a carraige return will cause Zwei to
generate a name using (gensym).  This query includes a HELP
keystroke which displays all previously defined macros' names
(mouse-sensitively).  If the user clicks or spells out an
existing name, Zwei asks if it should replace the existing
definition.  If the user says no, then Zwei reprompts.  When
a name has been settled upon, both it and the array
containing the macro keystrokes are pushed onto
ZWEI:MACRO-ALIST as a new element.

Meta-X View Keyboard Macro now looks up macros in
ZWEI:MACRO-ALIST, using the same (mouse sensitive) HELP key
display as the query sequence which appears when finishing
macro definitions.

One of the advantages of this scheme is that through
judicious use of init files, ZWEI:MACRO-ALIST and Meta-X
Install Macro one can now easily use one's favorite macros
across cold boots.

Thanks to Keith for many useful suggestions and improvements." "saz" NIL 2797959749)
  (5 "More macro fixups -- among other things, this patch corrects
misleading macro installation and deinstallation messages. 

saz" "saz" NIL 2797970514)
  (6 "User is now informed of new macro's name, along with the sentence,
\"Use Meta-X Install Macro to associate a macro with a key.\"

  (7 "Meta-X View Keyboard Macro now prints out a readable message
upon encountering embedded keyboard macros (macros within 
macros) instead of generating an error.

  (8 "A change to SAVE-BUFFER pertaining to the handling of saving problems.

When a file appears to have changed behind the user's back, ZMacs says:

When you last read or wrote FOO,
it was... 
but now it is... 
Save it anyway?

Well, sometimes we can get into a situation where the problem occurs
every time we go to save a particular buffer.  So, now we allow the user
to answer Y, N, or P for \"proceed\", which means, \"stop bothering me
about this buffer\"." "keith" NIL 2798132964)
  (9 "ZMacs' READ-BUFFER-NAME is supposed to support creation of a new buffer;
but that feature didn't have a prayer of working, as implemented.  Now
that works.  Also, improve logic and user messages generally." "keith" NIL 2798758754)
  (10 "Refinement to READ-BUFFER-NAME: If DEFAULT arg is not a ZMacs buffer,
set current pathname defaults from current buffer.  This is better than
an arbitrary set of defaults, e.g. from previous buffer.  Does not
affect any existing ZMacs commands -- just some that I'm building." "keith" NIL 2798861516)
  (11 "Removes current buffer from completing-reader choice list of selectable
buffers while a zwei:kill-buffer is done.  If user is killing off last
buffer in existence, the mini-buffer \"Killing the current buffer, select
which other buffer?\" prompt will have no (existing) default, and typing
<Help> will provide no buffer names for mousing or typing. In this case,
the user types <Return> and lets Zwei create a new buffer, which is then
selected as the current buffer.

Thanks to Keith for crucial assistance." "saz" NIL 2799952187)
  (12 "To find out if given character was found in a list of delimeters,
COMPLETE-STRING was getting around \"character lossage\" by doing 2 MEMQs,
one on the character, and then on the INT-CHAR of the character.  Using
(LISP:MEMBER char list :TEST 'CHAR-EQUAL) is simpler and slightly faster." "keith" NIL 2800304322)
  (13 "Eliminate gratuitous use of ART-Q-LIST in ZMacs.  Change *FONT-STACK*
within an interval stream to be an ART-16B (number) array.  Do FIND instead
of MEMQing down ART-Q-LIST.

I've tested this by opening editor streams on font-ified files with
HACK-FONTS=T, and all looks well." "keith" NIL 2800371658)
  (14 "Improved MAIL function to check type of the USER argument.  USER must be
a string containing <known user>@<known host>, or else gives an
informative error.  Averts the incomprehensible error message
encountered as a result of passing in non-strings for USER." "saz" NIL 2800474417)
