  (1 "DIRED-PATHNAME-EQUAL doesn't blow up on arguments that aren't pathnames.
Also, it coerces strings into pathnames." "saz" NIL)
  (2 "DIRED.LISP modified extensively -- here are the major changes:

DIRED-PATHNAME-EQUAL accepts more types of arguments;
COM-DIRED-SUBDIRECTORY has added functionality for 
  inserting and removing subdirectory contents from a 
  Dired display;
New command `>' introduced, which moves cursor to 
  most recent version of current file;
HELP documentation updated and reformatted 
  so as to arrive in semantic screenfuls;
DIRED-PROCESS-FILES now makes sure that it has
  a file to process before doing anything.

stream caused by datatype error in STRING-EQUAL.

  - Keith and SAZ" "keith" NIL 2797883598)
  (4 "Zwei now implements a new alist mechanism for remembering
user-defined keyboard macros.  Upon completion of a keyboard
macro at any macro level, via Meta-X End Keyboard Macro or
its equivalent, control-x ) , the user is now asked to supply
a name for the macro.  If they wish to leave it unnamed
(\"temporary\"), typing a carraige return will cause Zwei to
generate a name using (gensym).  This query includes a HELP
keystroke which displays all previously defined macros' names
(mouse-sensitively).  If the user clicks or spells out an
existing name, Zwei asks if it should replace the existing
definition.  If the user says no, then Zwei reprompts.  When
a name has been settled upon, both it and the array
containing the macro keystrokes are pushed onto
ZWEI:MACRO-ALIST as a new element.

Meta-X View Keyboard Macro now looks up macros in
ZWEI:MACRO-ALIST, using the same (mouse sensitive) HELP key
display as the query sequence which appears when finishing
macro definitions.

One of the advantages of this scheme is that through
judicious use of init files, ZWEI:MACRO-ALIST and Meta-X
Install Macro one can now easily use one's favorite macros
across cold boots.

Thanks to Keith for many useful suggestions and improvements." "saz" NIL 2797959749)
  (5 "More macro fixups -- among other things, this patch corrects
misleading macro installation and deinstallation messages.

\"Use Meta-X Install Macro to associate a macro with a key.\"

upon encountering embedded keyboard macros (macros within 
macros) instead of generating an error.

  (8 "A change to SAVE-BUFFER pertaining to the handling of saving problems.

When a file appears to have changed behind the user's back, ZMacs says:

When you last read or wrote FOO,
it was... 
but now it is... 
Save it anyway?

Well, sometimes we can get into a situation where the problem occurs
every time we go to save a particular buffer.  So, now we allow the user
to answer Y, N, or P for \"proceed\", which means, \"stop bothering me
about this buffer\"." "keith" NIL 2798132964)
  (9 "ZMacs' READ-BUFFER-NAME is supposed to support creation of a new buffer;
but that feature didn't have a prayer of working, as implemented.  Now
that works.  Also, improve logic and user messages generally." "keith" NIL 2798758754)
  (10 "Refinement to READ-BUFFER-NAME: If DEFAULT arg is not a ZMacs buffer,
set current pathname defaults from current buffer.  This is better than
an arbitrary set of defaults, e.g. from previous buffer.  Does not
affect any existing ZMacs commands -- just some that I'm building." "keith" NIL 2798861516)
  (11 "Removes current buffer from completing-reader choice list of selectable
buffers while a zwei:kill-buffer is done.  If user is killing off last
buffer in existence, the mini-buffer \"Killing the current buffer, select
which other buffer?\" prompt will have no (existing) default, and typing
<Help> will provide no buffer names for mousing or typing. In this case,
the user types <Return> and lets Zwei create a new buffer, which is then
selected as the current buffer.

Thanks to Keith for crucial assistance." "saz" NIL 2799952187)
  (12 "To find out if given character was found in a list of delimeters,
COMPLETE-STRING was getting around \"character lossage\" by doing 2 MEMQs,
one on the character, and then on the INT-CHAR of the character.  Using
(LISP:MEMBER char list :TEST 'CHAR-EQUAL) is simpler and slightly faster." "keith" NIL 2800304322)
  (13 "Eliminate gratuitous use of ART-Q-LIST in ZMacs.  Change *FONT-STACK*
within an interval stream to be an ART-16B (number) array.  Do FIND instead
of MEMQing down ART-Q-LIST.

I've tested this by opening editor streams on font-ified files with
HACK-FONTS=T, and all looks well." "keith" NIL 2800371658)
  (14 "Improved MAIL function to check type of the USER argument.  USER must be
a string containing <known user>@<known host>, or else gives an
informative error.  Averts the incomprehensible error message
encountered as a result of passing in non-strings for USER." "saz" NIL 2800474417)
  (15 "Use new SOURCE-COMPARE escape character handling to avoid extreme
lossage caused by font changes in Meta-X Source Compare and Source
Compare Changes.  (Making the same change to Source Compare Merge might
break it even worse.)" "keith" NIL 2801256018)

An explicit COMPILATION-ENVIRONMENT may be passed in.

  (20 "Introducing new Zwei REFIND FILE commands:
Control-Meta-X REFIND FILE
  Updates a buffer to contain current file contents, based
  on modification, filename specification, and disk status
  information.  Queries the user in most cases, unless nu-
  meric argument is specified, in which case no querying
  takes place; each buffer is updated w.r.t. disk if needed.
  For Dired buffers, update the display to represent current
  status of the Dired buffer's file specification.
  (see Specification for more details).
Control-Meta-X REFIND ALL FILES
  Updates all buffers as above; with numeric argument, omits
  queries.
Control-Meta-X REFIND FILES IN SYSTEM
  Updates all buffers in a specified system.
Control-Meta-X REFIND TAG TABLE FILES
  Update all buffers in a specified tag table.
Control-Meta-X REFIND FILES FOR MODIFIED BUFFERS
  Update every buffer which has been modified.
Control-Meta-X REFIND FILES FOR UNMODIFIED BUFFERS
  Update every buffer which has not been modified.
Control-Meta-X REFIND SPECIFIED FILES
  UPDATE all buffers selected by user from a pop-up
  choice menu containing all file-associated buffers.
Control-Meta-X REVERT ALL BUFFERS
  Sends a :revert message to all active buffers.
Control-Meta-X REVERT BUFFER IF NEEDED
  Sends a :revert message to the current buffer if
  it has been modified.
Control-Meta-X REVERT ALL BUFFERS IF NEEDED
  Sends :revert messages to all modified, active
  buffers.

Also, this patch contains numerous modularizations 
and corrections to the Source Compare commands'
interface, along with some new functions, used
in implementing the Refind commands:
  WITH-VERSION-AND-MODIFICATION-INFO
  FQUERY-UNLESS-ARG
  REPLACE-CURRENT-BUFFER-WITH-FILE

  (24 "For REFIND FILE, all cases now include an option (with equal,
option-exclusive status as the others) to \"...(W) Write buffer contents

specify the filename to write to, with (zwei:buffer-pathname *interval*)
being the default." "saz" NIL 2802699247)
  (25 "Here we modularize Zwei's COM-INSERT-DATE to call the new function,
INSERT-FORMATTED-OUTPUT; also, we add the COM-INSERT-CURRENT-USER-ID
