Also, it coerces strings into pathnames." "saz" NIL)
  (2 "DIRED.LISP modified extensively -- here are the major changes:

DIRED-PATHNAME-EQUAL accepts more types of arguments;
COM-DIRED-SUBDIRECTORY has added functionality for 
  inserting and removing subdirectory contents from a 
  Dired display;
New command `>' introduced, which moves cursor to 
  most recent version of current file;
HELP documentation updated and reformatted 
  so as to arrive in semantic screenfuls;
DIRED-PROCESS-FILES now makes sure that it has
  a file to process before doing anything.

stream caused by datatype error in STRING-EQUAL.

  (4 "Zwei now implements a new alist mechanism for remembering
user-defined keyboard macros.  Upon completion of a keyboard
macro at any macro level, via Meta-X End Keyboard Macro or
its equivalent, control-x ) , the user is now asked to supply
a name for the macro.  If they wish to leave it unnamed
(\"temporary\"), typing a carraige return will cause Zwei to
generate a name using (gensym).  This query includes a HELP
keystroke which displays all previously defined macros' names
(mouse-sensitively).  If the user clicks or spells out an
existing name, Zwei asks if it should replace the existing
definition.  If the user says no, then Zwei reprompts.  When
a name has been settled upon, both it and the array
containing the macro keystrokes are pushed onto
ZWEI:MACRO-ALIST as a new element.

Meta-X View Keyboard Macro now looks up macros in
ZWEI:MACRO-ALIST, using the same (mouse sensitive) HELP key
display as the query sequence which appears when finishing
macro definitions.

One of the advantages of this scheme is that through
judicious use of init files, ZWEI:MACRO-ALIST and Meta-X
Install Macro one can now easily use one's favorite macros
across cold boots.

Thanks to Keith for many useful suggestions and improvements." "saz" NIL 2797959749)
