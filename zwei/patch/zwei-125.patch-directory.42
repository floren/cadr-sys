  (1 "Zwei's Meta-X Set Base didn't have any default handling, which could
lead to spurious '*eof* value being your read and print base!  Fix
defaults here to display default (base 10.), let it be the yank
default, etc.  Similar for Set Readtable." "keith" NIL)
  (2 "Add COM-EDIT-BUFFERS to ZMacs command menu.  That rounds out the set of
useful buffer-listing/manipulating commands; this may be the most
useful." "keith" NIL)
  (3 "When you were using Dired on a directory one level down from the
root directory, if you typed the \"<\" command to edit the directory's
superior, Dired falsely claimed that there was none.  Now it
correctly edits the root directory." "pld" NIL)
  (4 "ZWEI's Lisp sectionization didn't understand definitions with
a package prefix.  (defstruct foo1) worked fine, but
(zl:defstruct foo2) didn't work." "pld" NIL)
  (5 "zwei:definition-function-start should not blow up if handed a null line." "pld" NIL)
  (6 "Add :COMPILE-FUN argument to control which compiler to use." "RWK" NIL)
  (7 "Now that LISP/Edit windows really work, let's make them easy to get to:

    System-Top-L is to LISP/Edit what System-L is to LISP/Listener.

(Get it? \"Top-L -- Top Level?\"  Thanks, Bob, for the suggestion.)

    -Keith" "keith" NIL)
  (8 "In List Tag Buffers, if there's no current search context (e.g., we're
at end of buffers) we weren't printing the search string at all.  Now,
print it at bottom of display.  (Even though it can't be used for
anything, the user may want to see it to verify that the search was
working ok.)" "keith" NIL)
  (9 "Improve ZMacs' spelling checker commands - particularly how they ensure
that the spelling checker is loaded.  Create the SPELL package if needed.
Etc." "keith" NIL)
  (10 "DIRED gets confused between pathnames on the host LOCAL: and the real local host.
This messes up renames when the host for the DIRED buffer is LOCAL -- the file
getting renamed may have the \"real\" host as its host component, and then DIRED would
think the new name was in a different directory, \"not in this display\".

Solve this by creating and using a new function, DIRED-PATHNAME-EQUAL.
It considers hosts \"LOCAL\" and SI:LOCAL-HOST to be equivalent for its
purposes.  Also, always compare pathnames with FS:PATHNAME-EQUAL, not EQ." "keith" NIL)
  (11 "In ZMacs Auto Fill Mode, if typing a space when cursor lay before the
last word on the line, and the typing of the space caused auto-fill-
hook to activate, the space would not self-insert.  ZWEI:AUTO-FILL-
HOOK failed to catch the case in which auto-filling left cursor at
end of the current line, not on the next one.

Now, if the point ends up on the same line it started on, and 
(BP-INDEX *POINT*) returns the same thing as (LINE-LENGTH LINE), the
space character is explicitly re-inserted (it is being deleted in all
cases)." "saz" NIL)
  (12 "If the *mini-buffer-default-string* wasn't coercable into a string, Yank
Default String would get an error.  Now, FORMAT it into a string." "keith" NIL)
  (13 "Remove the *FASD-INTERFACE* argument from the various remaining callers. --RWK" "RWK" NIL)
  (14 "Add Zmacs command Falcon Compile File, and make it available from clicking
  right on a list of buffers." "RWK" NIL)
  (15 "Errors from reading a symbol or definition name (e.g. in Edit Definition)
now print the reported error string, instead of merely \"Read error.\"

ZWEI's READ-FUNCTION-NAME prints the error if it receives one from
SYMBOL-FROM-STRING, which now returns an error object as its fourth
value (if applicable)." "keith" NIL)
  (16 "Made patch system more robust." "rwk" NIL)
  (17 "This was omitted from a previous patch that removed *fasd-interface*
args from Zwei compiler-calling functions." "keith" NIL)
  (18 "Fix COM-QUICK-DOCUMENTATION (used by Control-Shift-D) to avoid going
into the error handler when RELEVANT-FUNCTION-NAME returns a symbol that
is not a defined function.  Also, clean up logic and documentation." "keith" NIL)
