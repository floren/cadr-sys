put output into buffer." "keith" NIL 2804283053)
  (2 "Kill-Or-Save-Buffers improvements:

 1. Expanded window size (now takes up most of the screen for easier
viewing) -saz

 2. COMPILE option offered for any LISP syntax buffer. -keith

 3. Takes numeric arg (16, or Control-U Control-U), means initially mark
all buffers to be killed. -saz

 4. Display dots (. . .) so user can follow line from pathname to check
boxes. -keith+saz" "keith" NIL 2804534278)
  (3 "Zwei's Meta-X Kill Buffer now respects the work done by Meta-X Not Modified.

(The user is no longer warned that the \"Buffer ~A has been modified\" and asked
to \"save it first?\" if user found a way to make (send buffer :modified-p)
return NIL.)" "saz" NIL 2804630221)
  (4 "Fixed bogus max number of lines calculaton which blew up
in windows with non-default fonts." "smh" NIL 2804796203)
  (5 "When you SAVE-BUFFER for a file belonging to any system with the
:CTS-CONTROLLED attribitute, and if you haven't inserted at least
one CTS comment, ZWEI will now remind you to do so.  Enjoy!" "smh" NIL 2804799734)
