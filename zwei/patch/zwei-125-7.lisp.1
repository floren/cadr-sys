;;; Patch file for ZWEI version 125.7
;;; Reason:
;;;  Now that LISP/Edit windows really work, let's make them easy to get to:
;;;  
;;;      System-Top-L is to LISP/Edit what System-L is to LISP/Listener.
;;;  
;;;  (Get it? "Top-L -- Top Level?"  Thanks, Bob, for the innocent suggestion
;;;  when I couldn't think of the right key.)
;;;  
;;;  System-L still finds existing LISP/Edit windows, of course, but not
;;;  vice-versa, since people wanting a normal Listener may be very surprised
;;;  to get an editor-top-level.
