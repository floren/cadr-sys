    Can my mode hook functions for ZWEI access the values of attribute list
    variables in the current buffer ?
Well, in Zmacs they can.  Do (SEND ZWEI:*INTERVAL* ':GET ':PACKAGE), for example.
For some attributes, the value NIL means "use the default", and so you might
have to know what the default is, depending on what your application is doing.

In Release 4.0, Spire 6.9, site configuration 12, on Lisp Machine Six:

(load "<zvona.coder>macros" 'luser) when MACROS was compiled in package
SURFACE prompts about whether I want to create package SURFACE.  Giving
a package argument to LOAD should disable this.

It would be useful if all file errors had a procede type to bash the
file server and try again.

It would be useful if :load and related defsystem frobs would take a
package argument.  Sometimes a system wants to go in more than one
package, so you can't just use :package, and the -*- lines are wrong.

m-X Delete File with a wildcarded expression displays the files to be
deleted on the top typeout window and asks if you want to delete them in
the echo area.  Due to query-io being bound to the echo area in the
editor, presumably.  This seems to cause lossage a lot; it isn't
intuitive.

How about a DIRED operation which does a Find File In Other Window

This would be useful when you have to edit a number of files, but don't

I realise that it's often a great error check to see where parentheses
are (relative to identation) when READing from a ZMacs buffer, but
sometimes it looks better to have elements of a list line up in column
0, if the enclosing list is not ``too far'' from top level.  Couldn't
there be some variable to ignore the indentation style when reading from

Hi there !.  I have something I like to add to your wish list.

   Although Zwie's Auto Fill mode while in {TeX} mode tends to work very
well while typing in text, it tends to mess up when typeing in long
mathmatical equations.  What would be nice is automatically turn off the
Auto fill Mode while in TeX's Display Math mode {i.e. inside a \math{}
or a $${}$$ region, and then turn it back on when this is done.  Would
it be possible to do this ?

I frequently find myself typing text in comments in and around lisp

as though comments were text and the tab conventions within code behaved
as for code.  This could adversely affect those trying to put code in
comments, but I personally find myself using text more frequently.

There is a command to which you can bind TAB to get this behaviour.
In brand S systems it is called COM-INDENT-FOR-LISP-COMMENTS-SPECIAL,
it's been around for years, so I'm sure it's in LMIT systems under some name.

    it positioned the cursor in the right place.  Presumably it doesn't look for
    the form that is used: (defun (defmacro macro)...)

I think it uses that absurd syntax because it had to be able to work in
both the Lisp machine and Maclisp.

n is zero-based.  Right now it selects the fourth window that you cannot see,

It seems that the most consistent thing would be to barf on
out-of-range arguments, where an argument is out of range if it is
equal to or greater than the number of visible windows.  Note that if
this were extended consistently to the one-window-visible case, it
would barf if you did c-x o with no argument when there is only one
window visible.  I've argued for that before, actually.

This behavior would be fine in a Lisp Mode buffer, but it should do the

EE lispms would not be many patches behind if we had t-300s. It took
me 8 (count 'em, 8!) hours to generate an almost-up-to-date 4.0 band
which would fit on a T-80. When I have the time, I'll put it on
CADR-17.

Or you could use the MIT bands which don't need to be compressed.

Hmm.  eight hours to prepare bands for EE's T-300's?  I guess
I'll put someone on the tsk of making and compressing a 4.2 band
for those machines.  It should only take about 4 hours including
transport.

I made and announced a 4.1 that had been compressed and configured
for MIT, and installed on a couple MIT machines.  I haven't
checked what you've done to the disk labels on the T-80's, but
I think that should fit.

    I compiled a file in my zmacs buffer...

What command did you give that put you back in a Lisp Listener after a
compilation?  Compile File, Compile Buffer, etc. don't have that
behavior -- they just puts you back at editor top level.  I suppose
you mean that you compiled your buffer using Compile and Exit
(Meta-Z).

In System 93, the Compile File command now types out "done" when it
finishes, so if the editor is not exposed when the compilation
finishes, your editor won't return to top level (since the typeout
will be deferred until the editor is exposed again).  So if you used
Compile File and then left ZMacs in some random way, you would run
into this in 93 (but not in 91 or earlier, since the confirmation of
the finish of compilation was recently added).

In ZWEI in MIT-Specific 18.1, System 93.44, ZMail 49.18, microcode 226,

When I visit a tags table that was updated with Tags Rescan under Emacs, if I
do a tags search, the files that are Find File'd are ps:<foo>foobar.del.0, not
just foobar.del.  So if I already have the latest version of the file in a
buffer, that file is not searched; I get a duplicate buffer.  This takes longer
and is a pain.

If one edits non-lisp code (I find myself editing 11 code a lot, because
sometimes it's not clear if the bug is on the 11 or on the lisp machine) in
Zwei, it doesn't help much to use a tags table, because there's no Find Tag.
It would be nice if there were, seeing as one can do a Visit Tag Table anyway.

There's also no Tags Rescan, although that's asking a bit much.

Experimental Macsyma 6.15, site configuration 12, on Zarniwoop:

Could the code that saves minibuffer commands so that they can be
re-executed with C-X Altmode filter out duplicates, at least duplicates
that immediately follow one another.  If I do Meta-X A, then do Meta-X B
a whole bunch of times in a row, it would be convenient if I could
re-execute the A using C-X Altmode, rather than being given a whole
bunch of choices of B.

    Experimental Macsyma 6.15, site configuration 12, on Zarniwoop:

    It would be nice if the Update Attribute List and Set Backspace commands
    could agree on the "proper" way to specify a binary mode's value in the
    attribute list.  Update Attribute List likes to say "Backspace: T" while
    Set Backspace likes to say "Backspace: Yes".  I realize that both will
    work, but that is for the benefit of those humans who prefer to edit the
    attribute list line themselves; the automatic mechanisms should pick
    something they like and stick with it.  If it matters, I prefer the
    Yes/No version.

There isn't any Yes/No version.  No isn't NIL, so it means the same
thing as Yes.  Yeah, I know, this is stupid.  Either attribute lists
should be changed such that No will mean NIL, or the editor commands
should stop using "Yes".  The former has the following problem: it means
that there would have to be a database of which property names are of
the Yes/No variety (you wouldn't want to convert "Mode: No", for
example), and so if you created your own keywords, their definition
would have to be loaded before any files using those keywords were seen.
That might be acceptable.  However, the latter solution is probably
easier.

Is there any way to type a logical pathname and say "I mean it; don't

logical pathname (e.g. "foo:bar;baz") the default filetype is inserted.

Perhaps altmode (which does nothing with a logical pathname) could mean
"convert this."  I could then edit it by hand.

Try M-X (or C-M-X, I don't remember) Split Screen.  It is a menu driven
screen partitioner.  Actually, I don't like the way it behave too much
since, when told to make more than two windows, it divides the screen

You can.  You have to click Right on Edit Screen to get the menu of
"screenoids" to edit, and then select the editor rather than Main Screen.
Otherwise you would be reshaping the editor itself rather than what
is inside it.

    Is there any way to type a logical pathname and say "I mean it; don't
    complete?" I like to have files with no file type.  If I type it as a
    logical pathname (e.g. "foo:bar;baz") the default filetype is inserted.

    Perhaps altmode (which does nothing with a logical pathname) could mean
    "convert this."  I could then edit it by hand.

Well, you can define a canonical type of ZZ (or whatever), with the
meaning of "" (or :UNSPECIFIC, for example on Unix where you don't even
want the "." to appear in the translated name), on whatever system you
have that allows null file types.  In fact, this is the only way to do
this correctly, as it is the only way which will allow you to move the
files to systems which do not let you have null types!

Kill Or Save Buffers has two bugs:

--The Compile box, when moused, causes the check in the Save box to turn off.
  This is bad, since you usually want to save and compile the latest version.

--Even when you explicitly check both the save & compile boxes, it compiles BEFORE
  saving the current buffer. Shouldn't you first save out the buffer.. THEN compile
  the latest version?

I tried <DLW>ATTR.LISP for changing attributes of buffers.  Two problems are that it
won't change the FONTS attribute since it doesn't have an ATTRIBUTE-PRINTER for it
and ATTRIBUTE-PUTPROP doesn't take effect immediately on a buffer which is being
displayed.  Shouldn't it change any existing displayed buffers immediately, or have an
optional DO-IT-NOW? flag, or should the user follow calls to ATTRIBUTE-PUTPROP by
a Reparse Mode Line?

That is not what I want really, since that means I can use up every last disk

The tags formats are the same too.  Do you actually use :TAGS and

    I would like to "save the state of the buffer" at some point, 
    then allow some editing operations, then later optionally
    restore the saved state [edited text, point and mark].
A more extensive explanation of what it is you're trying to do
would be helpful, but I'll do my best without this information.

    - Save the buffer by COPY-INTERVAL, POINT and MARK by
    COPY-BP. 

Well, depends on exactly what you're trying to do.  But copy-bp will
create a second bp pointing into the same original buffer, not into
the copy produced by copy-interval.  There really ought to be a way
to copy an interval and create analogous copied BPs with it, now that
you mention it; this never came up in Zwei's implementation so I never
did it.

    - As above, but make strings instead and use indices into strings.

Well, given the lack of the facility I mentioned, yeah, this might
be the best way.  There is a way to convert a BP into a numerical
index somewhere (I think m-X Revert uses this), and to go the other
way you can just use forward-char.

    - In the case I don't change buffers, but some buffer text
    has been edited, can I avoid save/restore on the buffer interval?

I don't understand this.

    - When do I need MOVES type bp's vs. NIL type bp's?

There are three kinds: normal, moves, and nil.  The nil kind do not
relocate when text is inserted or deleted; they are invalid after
an insert or delete has happened and should not be used, since they
might point into a deleted line, or off the end of a line.  Normal
and moves relocate properly and are almost identical, the only
difference being what happens if text is inserted at exactly the
place that the BP points: normal ones end up before the inserted
text and moves ones end up after it.

I suppose I was a little off the handle in my response, but at the time
it seemed absurd to me that useful features should be flushed.  Now I
see that someone doesn't consider TAGS useful, so at least it's internally
consistent now...

I use TAGS in Zwei for two reasons:  To get functionality in editing
Lisp code not otherwise present in Zwei, and also for editing code
other than Lisp.  Presumably the DEFSYSTEM mechanism could subsume the
tags functions.  However, people still use Zwei for editing text that
isn't Lisp.

For instance, I used to use Zwei to edit the Logo source code, since
only in Zwei (or Multics EMACS) could I have two copies of the source.
PGS uses Zwei for editing the MINITS when he's working with the
LISPM/PUMA interface.  For these and similar applications, a common
TAGS database accessible by Zwei and EMACS is necessary.

Recently I wanted to search for all references to a certain variable and
alter them.  I could find no way to do this without Tags.  Looking for
all functions which send a certain message is a similar case.  The Zwei
Edit Callers function is not general enough for these occasions.

The Tags mechanism is well tested and understood.  Don't remove it, even
if you provide similar functionality for editing Lisp systems.  (Although
I would hail DEFSYSTEM versions of the various Tags functions.)

They're the best way I know to go rooting around lots of code.

OK, now I understand.  Well, there isn't really any need to remove the
tags stuff; all that we need to do, in order to satisfy the goals I'd
like to aim for, is to rename Tags Search and friends such that they
refer to a more general concept of a set of files (Set Search, maybe),
and then just say that loading a tags table is one of many ways of
setting up a Set.  So we'll probably do that, at some point.

To: BUG-zwei@MIT-OZ

In zwei in Release 4.3, site configuration 28,
Educational Computing Group, on Lisp Machine Twenty:

I did ^X-A (Append to Buffer), and gave a new buffer name.  A few
moments later, I did ^X-B FOO, where the buffer FOO didn't exist,
either.  It left me in the buffer with the appended text in it.

Furthermore, any subsequent ^X-B requests for new buffers return to that
same buffer, and give it a new name.  The lossage goes away if you kill
the wedged buffer.

This sounds like the bug where you get a buffer name shared with the mini-buffer
text.  It has indeed been fixed.  I could not say whether it will appear in
a later release 4 minor release.

This means I am unable to use editor commands to, for example, prune

This is an illegal reply from the file server to a perfectly legitimate

since the command was COMPLETE, not OPEN.

You really should talk to whoever is in charge of software on that VAX
and get them to install a file server that works.  Probably EDDIE is
running some ancient file server that dates back to the days when
completion wasn't implemented on Unix.

Many people in the vision group use files with Multiple fonts.
Over the last year, RMS has modified many CADR functions to make 
fonts transparent to ZWEI. Since there are now a few 3600's
available on the 3rd floor, we have started converting our code
but, as expected, we encountering fonts bug that were present
in both systems 9 months ago.

The problems are:

a) The mouse does not recognize functions names
   when in a different font (Meta-.)
b) ZWEI can't find the function definition when
   the function name is not in the standard font 
   (again in M-.). It keeps asking for a file name.
c) [I haven't checked this myself but was told about
   it] Files with multiple fonts don't compile
   properly (the font data is used as part of the
   variables).


Other related problems may also arise but i 
can't remember them.

A large amount of time has been spent in the
creation of multiple font files and we would
like to keep using them if possible.

While editing text I had my cursor on a word.  I then typed meta-$ to check the spelling.
It was wrong so I choose the correct option.  It then asked me if I wanted to do

occurrences.  Unfortunately, it left the cursor at the top of the buffer now.
I think in this case it should leave the cursor where it originally was when
I called the command.  In fact, even if it had found other occurences it would be nice
for the cursor to end up back where it started.

Subject: function not getting recompiled.

In zwei in Release 4.5, site configuration 62, on Lisp Machine Robot-3:

With a function in a buffer, compile it with C-Sh-C.  Then edit one of
the lines of the function, put just that line in the region, and compile
the region.  (This is a reasonable thing to want to do, if that line
sets a global variable and you don't want to have to execute the entire
function again).  Then type M-X Compile Changed Definitions of Buffer.
It won't recompile the function.  This is a wrong, since the function as
a whole has not been recompiled.  Or is this some kind of feature?

Is there some way to have the lispm ask for confirmation when

That is, if I ^X^W FOO.BAR.1 and there is already a FOO.BAR.1 it should
prompt and say "Overwrite?  (Y or N)."

When using ctrl-x ctrl-f to find a file:
In my directory I had the following.
src:<alr>failure-rules.lisp
src:<alr>failure-rules.fasl

I typed 
src:<alr>fa

to the mini buffer and the asked for completion.  It completed the name correctly, but
then seems to add the default type to the filename.

If the current buffer has the file ps:<alr>foo.bar

the filename would have completed to

src:<alr>failure-rules.bar

Subject: Suggestions for Fill Mode.
To: BUG-ZWEI at MIT-OZ

In ZWEI in System 97.12, CADR 1.0, ZMail 51.2, MIT-Specific 21.0,
microcode 257, ZM MIT, on Lisp Machine Two:

The following are some behaviors that don't seem obvious.

When using auto-fill mode for text;  Assume you are typing at the end of a line that
is in the middle of a paragraph.
For instance, let's say the cursor was at the end of the previous line.
When you type past the fill mark and it brings the cursor to the next line, the line
that the cursor is now on still contains what was previously there.  This is annoying,
since you are now typing with the cursor right in front of the lines text.
It would be more appropriate to insert a carraige return after the cursor so that it
was starting on a line that only contained the text that was moved from the end of the
line you were orignally typing on.  If this is not clear, I will be glad to show someone
what I mean.

When typing in a small paragraph at the top of the screen, I typed a meta-Q.  Part of the
paragraph was above what was showing.  After justifying the paragraph it recentered the text
so that I was now in the middle of the screen.  I can understand that it wants to show the
whole paragraph that is justified, but the gross screen movement was not necessary since only
a couple lines were off the screen.

Subject: Wanted:  Documentation about Interfacing to Zwei AND A Winning Structure Editor
To: MMcM at SCRC-TENEX
Cc: Bug-Zwei at MIT-OZ, Tim at MIT-OZ
Fonts: CPTFONTB

There is a lack of documentation:

Zwei is just what the world needs:  a "language" for writing editors in (substitute "system" for
"language" if you prefer).  The problem is, as you probably already know, is that there is no
nationally advertised set of conventions for simply extending Zmacs or for building some new
special-purpose display-oriented frobboz.  I am particularly interested in revolutionary new
display frobs, specifically in the area of debugging tools.  

So I pose the question:

How long will it be before the deep dark inner secrets of Zwei become "official"?  We really
can't keep on guessing about the "right" way to interface to Zwei.  Some of MIT's best wizards
have failed in their valiant attempts to use Zwei for relatively straightforward applications.
Looking at the sources (while constantly fearing that things will change in the next release) is
not the right thing.  Besides, if (God forbid!) you should ever decide that your customers don't
really need to have the sources at their site, then they would be completely screwed.  They
would have a customizable, extensible... undocumented... er... un-customizable, un-extensible,
display editor!  And the world doesn't need just another display editor.


The world could really use a Zwei-based structure editor.

It seems so close, yet so far away.  The current concept of a structure editor (a la Interlisp,
for example) could be vastly improved upon by keeping text (in upper and/or lower case,
different fonts, comments, etc.) IN PARALLEL with the Lisp object being edited.  Updating of the
Lisp object could be delayed if the text were to specify some impossible state, but conversely,
if the Lisp object were changed, the text would be updated immediately.  In a sense, the Lisp
object would be "wired" to the screen.

What do you think?  C'est reasonable?  C'est in ze works?  C'est no, I'll write one, if you tell
me how to really win with Zwei.


P.S.  Are people safe investing in British Petroleum?
