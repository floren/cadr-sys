;;; Written in 1982 by RMS -- feel free to use it,
;;; provided you return all improvements for redistribution.

;;; This file deals with manipulating lists of "possibilities" -- things to look at or go to.
;;; Possibilities are used for recording functions to visit for List Callers, etc.
;;; and also for recording places to find definitions in Edit Definition.
;;; The list is recorded in a ZWEI buffer; each possibility is attached to one line
;;; of the buffer, and you can go to that line and type a command
;;; to go to that possibility.

;;; A possibility is a line whose plist contains properties :POSSIBILITY and :LEVEL.
;;; When one possibility generates others, it gives those others lower :LEVELs.

;;; Executing a possibility can call make-buffer-current, so you cannot
;;; in general use possibilities except in ZMACS.
;;; Also, the possibilities themselves live in ZMACS buffers.
;;; But you can use possibilities outside ZMACS as long as you know
;;; that you are using a possibilities buffer which cannot contain
;;; any possibilities that might try to switch buffers when executed.

;;; Going to a possibility can insert more possibilities, as new lines,
;;; following that line.
