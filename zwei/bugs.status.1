*) If you View or DIRED a non-existent directory and specify another name
 to use instead, ZWEI now knows which directory it actually read.  C-X C-D also.
*) Mode hooks such as auto-fill-if-appropriate work in ZMAIL again.
*) C-Shift-D is now COM-QUICK-DOCUMENTATION.  It is invoked like C-Shift-A:
 it operates on the function which point is inside a call to,
 or use a numeric argument and specify the function name with the mini buffer.
*) ZWEI:ZMAIL called from Meta-Altmode will no longer wedge the editor on return.
 (This is fixed only in the source.  The patch would take a few minutes to load).
*) Reverse Following List works properly within comments of various sorts.
*) C-X 4 T failed to find some tags even though they completed.  No longer, it appears.
*) M-L or M-U with argument that takes it past end of buffer now does
 everything to end of buffer rather than doing nothing.

*) Clicking with the mouse on the echo area no longer wedges ZWEI.
*) M-. when there are other definitions tells you to use "M-." with an arg.
 not "Edit Definition" with an arg (or whatever key is right).
 BTW, C-. never served this function.  It was always M-. with an arg.
*) The error asking for generic pathname of a dummy pathname is fixed.
*) The bug of trying to call ENTER-COMPILER-WARNINGS-CONTEXT is fixed.
*) Set Package followed by Update Mode Line works now.
*) Edit Definition of a microcoded function tells you what it is
 and offers to read in UCADR (If you say yes, remember it is safe to abort).
*) If you abort out of visiting a file in ZWEI, it is no longer the case
 that any symbols whose definitions had been parsed will point at the
 partially-filled dead buffer.
*) The bug of M-G and M-Q calling undefined functions is fixed.
 (A file's latest version had been accidentally deleted.)
*) Clicking on mouse-sensitive items (left over from previous commands'
 typeout) which switch files, etc. while you are in the mini buffer
 now aborts the mini buffer and does what your click asked for,
 rather than getting an error trying to do it in the mini buffer.

*) Packages are handled better in ZWEI.  If a file does not have a package
 known for any reason, ZWEI assumes USER.
 This default assumption affects only activities in ZWEI
 (such as evalling out of the buffer, and finding definitions).
 It does not have any effect on operations on the file
 (such as READFILE, LOAD, QC-FILE).
 Likewise for packages set in ZWEI with Set Package; they affect
 only operations in the buffer you do it on, not the file being visited.

 If you want to change a file's package "permanently", edit the mode
 line at the top of the file and then use M-X Reparse Mode Line.
*) Delete File and Rename File now should be faster and improved.
*) Compile File now reads a filename, not a buffer name.
 The new command Load File loads a file.
 Compile and Load File compiles only if the file has changed,
 then loads in any case.
*) The menu for click-right on a List Buffers now includes an Unmod item.
*) COMPILER-LET will indent like LET.
*) Copy File now handles numeric args as advertised;
 new commands Copy Text File and Copy Binary File are more
 convenient ways of specifying the mode of transfer.
*) Attempting to delete protected files on FC in DIRED now
 prints a good looking error message.
 The V command in DIRED, if you are pointing at a subdirectory,
 does a View Directory.
*) C-X O with a numeric argument specifies a window by
 counting starting from 1 at the top window.
*) COM-CANONICALIZE-WHITESPACE updates point properly.
*) C-X ^ works well with more than two editor windows.
*) the sequence
  M-X Execute Command Into Buffer
  M-X List All Directory Names
 now works properly.  Many other editor commands that produced
 ugly output in the buffer will now produce good-looking output.
*) It should no longer be possible to get two buffers with the same name.
*) You now get a warning if you visit a file whose name is similar
 to another file visited in another buffer.  Similar means that they
 have the same NAME component.
*) The Help character does useful things inside the search commands.
*) C-Q Abort and C-Q Break insert those characters.
*) The C-Q M feature is flushed.
*) C-Q R <quantity-type> to rub out a quantity now works.
*) The C-/ command in completing readers, which lists all possible inputs
 that contain any of the words in your string, now ignores empty words.
*) C-X M initially marks the *mail-n* buffer "not modified".
*) Loading QWABL files containing multi-line expansions should work.
*) Fill Long Comment bugs have been fixed.
*) Set Fonts reads its argument more robustly.  Commas are ok between font names.
*) Auto fill bugs have been fixed, including auto filling of comments.
*) Completion of buffer names should work more intuitively with buffer names
 that are made from pathnames.
*) :UNTYI in editor buffer streams backs up their buffer pointers.
*) Query Replace case preservation now understands strings that
 contain embedded words but are not just words.  For example,
 replaceing "1aaa" -> "2bbb" will turn 1Aaa into 2Bbb, etc.
*) The black horizontal lines in Converse now separate paragraphs.
*) The command Count Occurrences is accessible.
*) Leading spaces are ignored in completing reads
 (unless they actually complete the first word).
*) Kill or Save Buffers, if you save a buffer which has no file yet,
 offers the proper default filename and tells you which buffer it is saving.
*) The scroll bar works while you are inside Edit Definition
*) The pathname default in mail, dired, etc. buffers is now semi-useful.
*) The command Close Defun inserts enough close parentheses to end
 the current defun.
*) Lisp indent no longer fails on certain macros defined with &body.
*) A bug with visiting a multi-font file clobbering another buffer's fonts
 has been fixed.
*) Sending mail from ZWEI or ZMAIL now tries multiple hosts if your login
 host is down.
*) The commands M-# and C-X # for text justifier font commands now work.
*) In the next system, making variables such as *FILL-COLUMN* depend
 on the major mode will work with switching between ZWEI and CONVERSE and ZMAIL.
*) Grinding functions that have been compiled in the editor now
 shows the correct definition.
*) Flushing typeout with spaces no longer sometimes fails to ignore the spaces.
*) Break and Abort in incremental searches (and other things)
 now redisplay better.
*) Problem with Set Package on Buffer-1
*) It may work to read a new file into a read-only buffer.
*) Commands such as  Disassemble and Arglist ask about symbols in
 other packages if the one you type is not defined.
*) Improved prompting for Query Replace arguments.
*) Some string searches for strings not found will now fail as they should.
*) Argument and prefix commands are displayed in the typein area,
 not hiding the mode line, and with a check for rapid input as in EMACS.
*) Re-execution of old mini-buffer commands is improved.
 If you do C-X  and quit out of it, paradoxical things no longer happen.
 C-M-Y works to back up to a previous mini buffer within a command
 or to back up to a previous command.
 Mini buffer Help printouts now document what C-M-Y does.
*) DIRED flag-setting commands @, ! and # no longer clear the
 action commands such as D, P, etc.
*) SET-DEFAULT-FONT now does everything nice with editor windows.
*) Problem in Fasl Update getting DTP-TRAP read from ... error.
*) Functions whose definitions come from macros calls of the form
 (defsomething name ...) are now found automatically by Meta-.
*) In the next system, setting *FIND-FILE-EARLY-SELECT* to T
 will cause C-X C-F to display the first screenful of a newly
 visited file as soon as it is read in; then it will continue reading.
*) While reading pathnames in the mini buffer, type Control-Shift-Y
 to yank the default pathname, or Meta-Shift-Y to yank the last pathname you typed.
*) Clicking on Print Before in Trace menu reached by M-X Trace would lose.
*) In the source, an error while in View Directory (etc) does not hang.
*) Sentence motion commands parse paragraphs properly now.
*) The mouse blinker flashes less when you type.
*) Bug in Macro Expand Sexp fixed.
*) Select System as Tags Table considers the files in the order they
 appeared in the DEFSYSTEM.
*) C-U Space works in Converse now.
*) Evaluate and Replace into Buffer works at the end of the buffer now.
*) In system 86, M-. will always get definitions in the current buffer first.
*) M-X Arglist Return Abort no longer leaves minibuffer selected.
*) In system 86, C-M-L with arg can access all the buffers C-X C-B lists,
 except for DIRED and MAIL buffers that have been exited.
*) In system 86, the Display Font command will not bomb out.
*) The Whois in ZMAIL bug is fixed.
*) DIRED commands such as D, A, H etc. do not get errors if done on non-file lines.
 In system 86, if you abort while DIRED is reading the directory,
 you do not get an empty DIRED buffer.
*) Indent New Line Indent Function, Indent New Line New Line Function and
 Return Indents Mode exist, due to DULCEY.
*) In system 86, *NUMERIC-ARG-P* will no longer be unbound when mode hooks are run.
*) Putting a ZMACS window in Split Screen now works.
*) In system 86, Save All Files will ask all its questions first thing.
*) Describe Flavor tells you all the components of the specified flavor.
*) In system 86, you can Undo a Sort Lines
*) In system 86, the help messages of Control-Q come out slow enough to read.
*) In system 86, "Reading FOO 69" will be followed by "Done."
*) Edit Definition no longer blows up on multi-font buffers.
*) In system 86, aborting a Write File operation will no longer leave the
 buffer in a state where List Buffers and Kill or Save Files doesn't think
 it needs to be saved.
*) In system 86, if you type M-X or C-M-X at Edit ZMACS Command, you
 then get to type an extended command whose definition should be edited.

Bugs that seem to have gone away:
*) A problem selecting a message with the mouse in the ZMAIL summary window
 while you were composing a message.
*) Problem reading in ZMAIL;COMNDS >.
*) Problem reading in a file whose text uses more fonts than are defined
 in the file's mode line Fonts: property.
*) Problem with M-X C-M-X ... C-X 
*) Command Set Comment Col was already renamed.
*) Reap File on FC host showed deleted files.
*) c-m-X Extended String Search c-H ? deselects everything
*) Problem with QFILE asking for your user name when you complete a pathname
 in the minibuffer.
*) Aborting out of reading a directory left the directory open.
*) Aborting out of I-search now makes the prompt go away immediately.
*) Break Rubout Resume supposedly echoed funny.
*) E command in DIRED on subdirs of Twenex directories supposedly got error.
*) Select All Files as Tag Table ignores DIRED and MAIL buffers, etc.
*) Select System as Tag Table handles systems whose DEFSYSTEMs' source files
 are known but not read in.
*) Mini buffer entered recursively no longer wedges the editor.
*) C-M-F in a comment now moves over sexps in the comment
 as long as the sexps are on one line.  If the sexp doesn't finish in the
 one line, it beeps.
*) Fasl Update doesn't work -- I couldn't reproduce it.  If enough info
 can be supplied, it will get fixed.

An irritating bug of ztop mode is its lack of knowledge about

to redisplay the entire line every time another token-unit(a symbol,
paren, or list..) is pushed out onto the screen, regardless of whether
or not it is on a new continuation line.  The result is that it can take
almost forever to print out anything that is at all long.

That is not really my point.  I find c-. a convenient key for my own

I was mailing a letter, and hit END.  Then, due to machine slowness and
general brain-damage on my part, I decided that I must have typed one
END too few, and that as long as it wasn't sent, I would make another
change to the header.

   The message finished being sent, I was returned to the top level
configuration.  Then, the mail-header window that I had selected
appeared on top of the top-level list-of-headers pane.  At this point, I
could perform any operation in the lower panes, but could not use the
top pane since it was covered.  I could not select it either.

Finally fixed things by going into mail mode.  That caused the header
window to update itself (remove the subject), and allowed me to abort
back into normalcy.

standard.  I don't think any of them could have all that much

If the cursor is on the first character of a function definition (i.e.
an open parenthesis in column 1), and the previous function definition
has unbalanced parentheses (typically because it is half-written),
then the c-m-E command does not work (feeps).  This is because c-m-A
would go to the beginning of the previous definition, rather than
leaving the cursor where it is.

Emacs has the same bug, but I don't think that makes it less of a bug.
Probably rather than doing what c-m-A would, c-m-E should only move
backwards over comments and blank lines looking for another line with
a parenthesis in the first column.
