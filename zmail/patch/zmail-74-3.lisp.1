;;; Patch file for ZMail version 74.3
;;; Reason:
;;;  Fix UPDATE-ZMAIL-PROFILE-CHOICE-WINDOW so if Zmail window is not found
;;;  (e.g.  if user killed Zmail), it doesn't blow out.  Now it offers to
;;;  create ZMail window.  This is a big improvement for future patches that
;;;  define profile variables, since this gets called within LOAD-PATCHES,
;;;  when errors are unfortunate.
