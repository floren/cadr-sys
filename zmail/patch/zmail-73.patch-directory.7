  (1 "Tighten up use of *run-gmsgs-p*, which determines whether ZMail tries to
run GMSGS, an old Lab thing that doesn't work anywhere else in the world
(I suppose).  If the variable is :NO (the default), ZMail isn't supposed
to run GMSGS, but the logic was broken.

We don't know why this suddenly started happening -- did something else
get fixed to cause the old logic to \"work\"?" "keith" NIL)
  (2 "Further refinement to earlier patch to handling (non-existent) GMSGS
functionality.  Remove error trapping from host methods for :DO-GMSGS;
the GMSGS function now handles and prints out network errors. (This is
more consistent.)  Unfortunately, we cannot easily trap for the rename
problem for people who inadvertently have *RUN-GMSGS-P* set such that
they're running GMSGS by accident." "keith" NIL)
