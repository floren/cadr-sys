We don't know why this works...???" "keith" NIL 2800466672)

2. Fix UPDATE-ZMAIL-PROFILE-CHOICE-WINDOW so if Zmail window is not
found (e.g.  if user killed Zmail), it doesn't blow out.  Now it offers
to create ZMail window.  This is a big improvement for future patches
that define profile variables; this typically gets called within a
patch, and errors are unfortunate." "keith" NIL 2800573606)

  (5 "The \"Message sent\" message now adds time of sending, eliminating confusion
of returning to machine in ZMail and wondering just which message is being
referred to... Now looks like \"Message sent at 02-Oct-88 12:34:56.\"" "saz" NIL 2800842768)
