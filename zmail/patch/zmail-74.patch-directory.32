  (1 "Eliminate error in which user tries a c-m-Y while sending a message
prior to first Get Inbox of ZMail session." "saz" NIL 2798206394)
  (2 "Jim's fix that makes \"New mail...\" messages come out on the typein-window.
We don't know why this works...???" "keith" NIL 2800466672)
  (3 "1. Fix doc string for (ZMAIL). {bletch!}

2. Fix UPDATE-ZMAIL-PROFILE-CHOICE-WINDOW so if Zmail window is not
found (e.g.  if user killed Zmail), it doesn't blow out.  Now it offers
to create ZMail window.  This is a big improvement for future patches
that define profile variables; this typically gets called within a
patch, and errors are unfortunate." "keith" NIL 2800573606)
  (4 "Provides notification of new mail in inbox via Converse or TV:Notify.
External notification is done depending on value of new user variable,
*NOTIFY-ON-NEW-MAIL-IN-BACKGROUND*:

  - If NIL (the default), no external notification is given
  - If :NOTIFY, use TV:NOTIFY
  - If :CONVERSE or T, use QSEND to send message to user at 
    local machine. This is the mode I prefer..." "keith" NIL 2800575651)
  (5 "The \"Message sent\" message now adds time of sending, eliminating confusion
of returning to machine in ZMail and wondering just which message is being
referred to... Now looks like \"Message sent at 02-Oct-88 12:34:56.\"" "saz" NIL 2800842768)
  (6 "Fixes ZMail blowout bug caused by clicking in summary window while
editing a message.  When mouse input is received from outside the
message editing window, ZMail now gives user the option of exiting from
the current edit session (via an fquery in the mini-buffer).  

If user declines, Zmail complains of unknown mouse input, and the user
may continue editing.  If user accepts, Zmail quits the edit BUT DOES
NOT PROCESS THE MENU COMMAND/SUMMARY WINDOW ACTION INDICATED.  User must
reclick after escaping from the editing session.  

This behavior is analogous to the ZMail clicking behavior, while sending
mail, for clicking between original-msg, header, and reply-text panes.
The first click encountered from outside the current pane simply
replaces drops cursor at the top of the moused-in window, NOT to the
actual point clicked in the window.  A second mouse click after the
first has taken effect is required in order to actually move
zwei:*point* to the desired place in the pane." "saz" NIL 2800846137)
  (7 "Expunging zmail msg sequences no longer causes a jump to first message
in the sequence; instead, the user is left at the current message (if
still present after the expunge, or the one before it if not)." "saz" NIL 2801001539)
  (8 "ZMail now handles mouse clicks more robustly in message editing mode.

If, while editing a message in the bottom (message text) window, a user
clicks any mouse button in the top (summary) window, the editing is
saved, :edit mode is exited, and Zmail jumps to the clicked-on message
line.

If, while editing, the user clicks on a menu command, ZMail warns the
user that menu commands are not executable from within :edit mode, and
then fquery's the user as to whether or not to exit :edit mode at that
time.  If the user responds with \"Y\", :edit mode is exited, all editing
to the message is saved in the body of the message, the user is
presented with a reminder to click again to execute the particular menu
command, and the top level command loop is re-entered.

If the user responds with \"N\", then ZMail simply reminds you that the
<End> and the <Abort> keys may be used to exit an edit session when you
are finished with the text." "saz" NIL 2801026223)
  (9 "Now you can use the mouse to filter your ZMail messages by
sender/recipient.  Use the Select menu's \"Filter\" mode (i.e., click
middle on the Select menu item), click on \"From/To\" in the filter-making
window which appears, then click on a message sent from or to the
relevant user in the message summary (top) pane, and, finally, click on
the correct field in the typeout window... 

[An obvious future enhancement would be to break up this From/To
selection feature into separate From and To selection features.
Then, clicking on the relevant message will be unambiguous, and
the need for the second click (in the typeout window) will go
away!" "saz" NIL 2801171639)
  (10 "Fixes \"Parse Dead Message\" screw case..." "saz" NIL 2802261671)
  (11 "One more pass at the ZMAIL expunge behaviour...Last time, I *swear*." "saz" NIL 2802364384)
