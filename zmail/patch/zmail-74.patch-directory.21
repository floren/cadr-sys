  (1 "Eliminate error in which user tries a c-m-Y while sending a message
prior to first Get Inbox of ZMail session." "saz" NIL 2798206394)
  (2 "Jim's fix that makes \"New mail...\" messages come out on the typein-window.
We don't know why this works...???" "keith" NIL 2800466672)
  (3 "1. Fix doc string for (ZMAIL). {bletch!}

2. Fix UPDATE-ZMAIL-PROFILE-CHOICE-WINDOW so if Zmail window is not
found (e.g.  if user killed Zmail), it doesn't blow out.  Now it offers
to create ZMail window.  This is a big improvement for future patches
that define profile variables; this typically gets called within a
patch, and errors are unfortunate." "keith" NIL 2800573606)
  (4 "Provides notification of new mail in inbox via Converse or TV:Notify.
External notification is done depending on value of new user variable,
*NOTIFY-ON-NEW-MAIL-IN-BACKGROUND*:

  - If NIL (the default), no external notification is given
  - If :NOTIFY, use TV:NOTIFY
  - If :CONVERSE or T, use QSEND to send message to user at 
    local machine. This is the mode I prefer..." "keith" NIL 2800575651)
  (5 "The \"Message sent\" message now adds time of sending, eliminating confusion
of returning to machine in ZMail and wondering just which message is being
referred to... Now looks like \"Message sent at 02-Oct-88 12:34:56.\"" "saz" NIL 2800842768)
  (6 "Fixes ZMail blowout bug caused by clicking in summary window while
editing a message.  When mouse input is received from outside the
message editing window, ZMail now gives user the option of exiting from
the current edit session (via an fquery in the mini-buffer).  

If user declines, Zmail complains of unknown mouse input, and the user
may continue editing.  If user accepts, Zmail quits the edit BUT DOES
NOT PROCESS THE MENU COMMAND/SUMMARY WINDOW ACTION INDICATED.  User must
reclick after escaping from the editing session.  

This behavior is analogous to the ZMail clicking behavior, while sending
mail, for clicking between original-msg, header, and reply-text panes.
The first click encountered from outside the current pane simply
replaces drops cursor at the top of the moused-in window, NOT to the
actual point clicked in the window.  A second mouse click after the
first has taken effect is required in order to actually move
zwei:*point* to the desired place in the pane." "saz" NIL 2800846137)
  (7 "Expunging zmail msg sequences no longer causes a jump to first message
in the sequence; instead, the user is left at the current message (if
still present after the expunge, or the one before it if not)." "saz" NIL 2801001539)
