This report describes research done at the Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  Support for the
laboratory's artificial intelligence research is provided in part by the
Advanced Research Projects Agency of the Department of Defense under Office
of Naval Research Contract number N00014-80-C-0505.

This is a reference manual for ZMail, the Lisp machine system's facility
for reading, managing and sending mail.  It describes how to use ZMail,
but not how to customize it, except for the profile options which you
can set with ZMail's own profile editing mode.

Command names and names of keyboard characters are in bold face and
capitalized, as in 3Control* and 3Select Referenced Msg*.  Names of
menu items are also in bold face, except that italics are used for menu
items that appear on the screen in italics.  Menu items are capitalized
as they appear in the menu (or at least that is the intention).

A general knowledge of the conventions of operating the Lisp machine is
necessary for understanding this manual.  For the most part, you do not
need to know anything about programming in Lisp.  The exceptions are a
few functions that it may be useful for your programs to
call to interface with ZMail.

Many Lisp variables affecting ZMail's operation are documented in this
manual (all in the 3zwei:* package, though that is not stated
explicitly below).  These variables are ZMail profile options.  While
you can refer to or set them with Lisp code, generally you would set
them with the ZMail profile editor (see (profile)), which you can use
without knowing how to program in Lisp.  When a variable has a fixed
set of alternative values, these are documented as they would appear
in the ZMail profile editor.  The actual Lisp values of the variables
can be figured from the following rule: replace all imbedded spaces
with hyphens, and intern the string in the keyword package.  3Yes*
and 3No* are exceptions, represented by 3t* and 3nil*.

Any comments, suggestions, or criticisms will be welcomed.  Please send
Arpa network mail to BUG-LMMAN@MIT-OZ.

The Lisp Machine is a product of the efforts of many people too
numerous to list here and of the former unique environment of the
M.I.T. Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.  The author of this manual
believes that the commercialization of the computer industry
hinders the further development of systems such as described herein.
He considers proprietary software morally objectionable and
plans to dedicate his career to promoting the sharing and free
exchange of software.  For more information on this issue, write
to the address above.

ZMail was written primarily by Mike McMahon.  Sarah Smith helped to
correct this manual.  Eugene C. Ciccarelli (author of Babyl) wrote the
section on the Babyl file format, one day when the disks were not
getting too many errors.
