Subject: Templates

Suppose variables like Default CC list, Generate In-Reply-to,
Don't-reply-to and so on were all merged together into new user
objects called templates.  A template would be used to compose the
initial set of headers when entering mail mode.  These could come
either quoted or extracted from the message(s) being replied to,
forwarded, etc.  Also the text could be initialized for the bug
command and reply yank mode.

Some templates would be provided by the system.  Various commands
would default to using different templates, all of which would be
under user control.  Click right on Reply or Mail would give a menu of
templates (probably slightly different menus so as to give the correct
choices to the naive user.)

This would also provide the MM USER-HEADERS (postal address) feature.

Profile mode would include a template editor.  I have ideas for this,
but will send them under separate cover if the general idea meets with
approval.

Templates of a slightly different sort could be used to do header
reformatting.

ZMail version 38 is released with system 78.  About the only thing worth
noting is a new function ZWEI:ZMAIL-SAVE-ALL-FILES.  It works like
ZWEI:SAVE-ALL-FILES, but on your mail files read into ZMail.

Here are the changes for ZMail version 34, soon to be released with system 74.
Not much has happened recently.

There is now only one hardcopy option for specifying the font, rather
than the three separate parts of it.

Temporary mail files now kill themselves when they are expunged into
emptiness.  If anyone doesn't like this feature, or doesn't like it on
the current mail file, it can easily be made a user option.

There is a new mailing mode, Direct Chaos, which connects to each host
specified in a recipient.  This is probably only useful if none of the hosts at
your site can forward mail (e.g. they are all lisp machines).  The normal Chaos
mailing mode now tries several hosts before giving up.  COMSAT mailing mode
does NOT do this because it cannot control the headers generated and so must
always mail through the login machine.

Here are the changes for ZMail version 33, which comes with system 73.

There is a new user option to inhibit the background process' periodic
check for new mail.

The Filters, Mail files, Universes, and Keywords buttons in Profile mode
can now be used to edit the associations between filters and keywords,
mail files or universes.

Here are the changes for ZMail version 31, which comes with system 72.

End is now undefined at top level.  If you like the old meaning, put
(SET-COMTAB *ZMAIL-COMTAB* '(#\END COM-QUIT)) in your ZMAIL init file.

Delete Referenced Msg and related commands will now skip searching the
current mail file first if given an argument.

A new hardcopy option allows you to specify a line for separating
messages when they are all output on the same page.

It is now a user option whether local mail starts out with a subject.
The default behaviour has not changed.

There is now a user option to force you to give your outgoing messages
subjects.

New user options allow specification of initial Cc and Fcc fields on
all outgoing mail.

There is a new experimental command mode which does away with the map
command.  The idea is that every command can optionally take a filter
and universe as arguments.  This mode is gotten by the Experimental
entry in the Configure menu.  If you try it, please mail your comments
one way or the other on it -- based on those it is subject to radical
change or being flushed entirely.

The format of the summary display is now parameterizable on a per
mail-file basis.  If not specified for a particular mail file, it is
taken from the Default Summary Format user option.  This option can be
T, meaning include the date, or NIL, meaning do not.  The default is now
to include the date, since that seems to have been prefered by most
people who cared.  More complicated formats than these two are specified
by a list of alternating indicators and values, where value specifies
how the field given by the indicator is printed.  For example, T expands
into (:SIZE 5 :DATE :DATE :RECIPIENTS 23. :KEYWORDS T :SUBJECT T) and
NIL into (:SIZE 5 :RECIPIENTS 23. :KEYWORDS T :SUBJECT T).  Here are the
indicators currently defined and how their associated values are
interpreted:
:SIZE <number-of-columns>
:DATE :DATE, :TIME, or :DATE-AND-TIME
:RECIPIENTS <total-number-of-characters>
:KEYWORDS <ignored>
:SUBJECT <ignored>
New indicators can be easily defined by defining the appropriate
function, see the code or someone knowledgeable for more details.
The variable *SUMMARY-INCLUDE-DATE*, whose T/NIL value is a subset of
the above, is obsolete, but will be understood for several systems.
Editing your profile will change to the new name.

Here are the changes for ZMail version 28, which comes with system 70.

Both window mode is now the default when ZMail starts up.  Most people
seem to have set this in their init files anyway.

Commands whose behaviour depends on user options or defaulting now have
their who line documentation dynamically updated.  Please report any
commands which seem not to obey this rule.
The choice options in profile mode should now have better who line
documentation.

The change to seen/unseen mentioned some time ago has been installed.
Unseen is now the primitive attribute available in the filter menu and
so on.  If your init file has filters that use the SEEN property, you
will need to change them.

The middle button on the summary window is treated like the middle
button on menus.  It is a user option exactly what it does, the default
is delete.

The --More-- is now mouse sensitive and clicking on it scrolls the
current message.

There is a new command Delete Duplicate Msgs.  It deletes all messages
in the current mail file with headers EQUAL to another message in there.
This is useful after timing errors with COMSAT and when merging several
overlapping mail files together.  Note that the EQUAL predicate used
ignores things like Redistributed-by, etc., so it works if you got two
copies that way too.

There is now a user option to allow you to send messages from the main
Message window.  Some people may find the speed improvement this gives
enough to warrant using it.

Some new commands along the lines of Select Referenced Msg.  They are
Delete Referenced Msg, Append to Referenced Msg, and Move In Place Of
Referenced Msg.  The last finds the message referenced by the current
message, deletes it, and moves the current message into its mail file
near it.  This is a useful operation when you receive a message giving
more details on a message which still requires some action on your part.

The Move to File and Keywords commands now work cleverly when invoked
with the middle button.  Users can define an alist of filters and move
mail files or keywords (respectively).  ZMail will apply each filter
in turn to the relevant message.  In the move case, the mail file
corresponding to the first matching filter will be used.  In the
keywords case, all keywords for all matching filters will be added.
This is currently not interfaced to profile mode, but the alists are
called *FILTER-MOVE-MAIL-FILE-ALIST* (list of (filter . mail-file))
and *FILTER-KEYWORDS-ALIST* (list of (filter . keywords)) if you want
to experiment with this.  The reference matching stuff is also driven
off of *FILTER-REFERENCE-UNIVERSE-ALIST*.  I imagine most people will
find it sufficient to make this the same as
*FILTER-MOVE-MAIL-FILE-ALIST*.

Automatic deletion of expired messages is now by default on a per file
basis.  A new command Set Expiration Date lets you add an
Expiration-Date field to the current message.

Simple filtering by subject or address fields can now be done from the
Filter option in the summary window's pop up menu (the one you get
clicking right on a message there).

When a mail file is loaded in, the background process will start parsing
all the messages in it.

Here are the changes for ZMail version 27, which comes with system 69.
There are some new experimental features which haven't been fully worked
out yet.  They are outlined below and you can contact me for more
details or if you have suggestions on them.

Many commands in the main menu now treat the middle mouse button
specially.  For example, Mouse middle on the Mail command gives the Bug
command and Mouse middle on the Delete command is the same as C-D.  In
most of these cases, the exact meaning of the middle button is a user
option.

It is possible to reply to more than one message at a time via Map
Over/Reply.  All the messages will be marked as answered and will be
yanked by C-M-Y, etc.

Messages that are forwarded now get the forwarded attribute after
sending is complete.

Mail files should not claim to need saving out when their text itself
has not changed.  This used to happen when a message in an RMAIL file
got marked as answered or seen, even though those attributes cannot be
stored in an RMAIL file.

The Fcc header in Mail mode is recognized specially and a message
generated and treated as by Move to File, thereby bypassing the mailer.
There is a command in the Mail mode menu to insert an appropriate Fcc
field for one of the known mail files.

Various options on mail files, such as append vs. prepend, are now
settable from profile mode.  This same set of options is offered when a
new file is created via Mouse right on Find File.

ZMail can now recognize when one message references another, either by
the headers of the original being yanked into the text of the reply, or
via an In-reply-to field (of which about half a dozen different formats
used by the various mail systems around the net are understood).  There
are new commands for selecting all the messages referenced to by the
current message, and for jumping to the single message referenced by the
current message.  This is very useful when you see a message saying
someone else has taken care of a message you saved away some time ago.

The promised new more general address parser is installed.  It
understands a superset of the soi disant standard (RFC733).  There are
some new profile switches to allow you to format outgoing replies with
the address format of the original (like what Babyl does on Tops-20
now).  You have to use CHAOS sending mode rather than COMSAT request
file sending mode of course to have control over these headers at all.

There are new editor commands, analogous to the word, sexp or character
commands, for moving by and deleting addresses.  They use the same
parser.  Distributions lists and similar things that nest addresses
behave like LISP lists.  These commands are not installed anywhere at
present.  If no one has a better suggestion, i guess they will be put on
Hyper-F, Hyper-B, etc. while inside ZMail.

There is a user option for automatically generating In-reply-to fields
when sending replies.  Once again, CHAOS sending is required to get
these out through COMSAT.

ZMail now has a Redistribute command.  It will work even if you normally
use COMSAT sending mode by temporarily using CHAOS sending mode.

Babyl mail files can now have a sort predicate associated with them.
Whenever a message is moved into the file, it will be merged in
according to this predicate.  Clicking middle on the Sort command will
sort the mail file according to its associated predicate, in case the
messages got put in by some other mail system or something like that.

Subject: Query
To: INFO-ZMAIL at MIT-AI

I would like to know what people would think about adding one more line of menu
to the command menu, to allow access to some commands without having to go through
as many menus.  For example, a "Filter" menu entry would mean you could filter
your messages without going through the "Select File" menu, a "Bug" menu entry
would similarly eliminate going through the "Mail" menu, or a "Rev Delete" entry
would be the same as ^D to allow reverse deletion from the mouse.

Do people think this would be a good change?  What items would you want to see
promoted to the main menu?   I'll save out replies to AI; ZMAIL; MENU QUERY

If you have a compiled zmail init file which defines filters, it will
need to be recompiled for system 67 zmail 21.  If you have filters that
call other filters, you should use MSG-FITS-FILTER-P rather than just
funcalling.  All this because filters are no longer stored in the
function cell of the name of the filter.

Would anyone object to automatically generated temporary mail files
(ones named "Temp") being recycled only when they get emptied, rather
than every time around like they are now?  That is, each successive
filtering operation would get you a new one.  They could arrange
automatically to have more meaningful names.  If anyone does, i guess
i'll make control of it an option.

Subject: Changes for ZMail 19
To: INFO-ZMAIL at MIT-AI

Here are the changes for ZMail version 19, which comes with system 65.

The handling of new mail has been changed extensively.  GMSGS works
right by allowing new mail to come from multiple files.  Having a
_ZMAIL file from a previous machine crash doesn't cause ZMail to
forget to read in any real new mail.  There are a couple of new user
options for causing GMSGS to be run when getting new mail and
supplying more switches (JCL) to it.  If you use RMAIL, setting the
run-gmsgs switch also causes your XUNAME GMSGS file to be read in.  If
you use Babyl, you should change your Babyl file to have
Mail: AI: USERS3; ZIPPY MAIL, AI: USERS3; ZIPPY GMSGS.
BABYL knows what this means at least, even though it doesn't support
multiple input files itself yet, so you can be compatible.
The M-X Gmsgs command works with the new scheme in case that's really
what you want.

If you supply a filename to the Get New Mail command, the file will
NOT be deleted.  This is compatible with the 1G command in Babyl, and
seems safer.

Profile mode has been rearranged somewhat.  It now has submodes for
things that used to be in the menus at the top.

Commands that give a menu when you click right on them and default when
you click left always work that way.  That is, they never bring up the
menu when you click left, but instead give an error.  That means, for
example, that the first time you send want to use the Bug command from
the Mail command, you must click right on the "Bug" item so that you can
get the list of possibilities.

There is a new command M-X Enable Background Process When Deexposed for
when you want to go do something while your new mail is reading in.

There is a new command COM-ZMAIL-DELETE-AND-SAVE-MSG like the K command
in Babyl.  The COM-ZMAIL-YANK-MSG command works with it like the Y
command.

Hardcopy mode now supports the XGP.  The code in that area has been
cleaned up a great deal, if anyone is possessed to add a new hardcopy
device, he/she should have an easier time.

If you use Babyl, it should now almost work to read mail on Tops-20.  It
is likely to write out greater and greater versions of USER.BABYL, and
the current Babyl probably still only looks for version 1.

Everything that is mouse sensitive should provide who-line
documentation.  If you spot something that doesn't, please report it.

Here are the changes for ZMail 16, which comes with system 59.

More commands default when you click left on them.  In particular, Map
Over and Other now remember the last command of that type and default to
that.

There is now support for reading and writing Tops-20 format mail files.
It still doesn't work to read your new mail there, this will be coming
shortly (if you use Babyl).

Subject: seen vs unseen
To: INFO-ZMAIL at MIT-AI

Do people think it would be an improvement to have the "unseen"
attribute be fundamental and "seen" be not "unseen"?  "Unseen", being
less common, seems more interesting.  I can imagine confusion about
double negatives though.

Date: 30 January 1981 01:10-EST

Subject: Notification of upcoming changes for ZMail 15
To: INFO-ZMAIL at MIT-AI

Here are the major changes in ZMail version 15, which will be coming
shortly with system 57.

ZMail now saves drafts of every message you send.  It has done this
since version 14, but unless you clicked right on Continue you probably
didn't notice.

Drafts can now be saved in a mail file (a la RDMAIL) as well as in a
disk file (a la MM).  The idea is that one is used to guard against your
machine crapping out and the other to let you continue writing a message
at some later date without forgetting about it.  The C-X C-M-S command
in Mail mode saves into the mail file (this character may be changed if
someone has a better suggestion).  There is a user option if you don't
want this to be your BABYL/RMAIL file.

The Continue command lets you restore drafts from messages or files.
Replying to a draft message is the same as continuing it (by the same
mechanism that treats replies to COMSAT specially).

Messages can be printed via Move to File/Hardcopy for people who are
into that.  New hardcopy devices are easy to add, current ones are
dover and tpl.

Analogies of all the point-pdl commands in the editor exist for moving
between messages.  Only C-Space is installed by default.

A few random commands: COM-ZMAIL-KILL-RING-SAVE-MSG, COM-ZMAIL-YANK-MSG
COM-LIST-MAIL-FILES.

The pop-up information window (the one that said you have new mail) and
the pop-up mode line (the one that took a long time to tell you you
mistyped something) have been flushed, since they exercised so many bugs
in the window system.  There is now a second line at the bottom like in
the editor.  Commands that seem to be reading from the wrong part of the
screen (other than where your attention was already) should be reported.

ZMail supports Babyl file format version 5, which will be coming into
BABYL' someday soon i gather.  Support for versions 4 and 5 will both be
present until the new BABYL is well established.

Mail files are now flavor objects.  I hope this change has no
user-visible effects.  It is in preparation for more changes in the near
future for other formats of mail file.

There is a new temporary command M-X GMSGS at top-level.  It will go
away as soon as multiple input files are supported, but for now will let
you avoid logging into ITS just to do that.


MMcM@MIT-AI 01/22/81 22:42:33
To: INFO-ZMAIL at MIT-AI
Do people think the pop-up-information window (the little one in the
corner that says you have new mail and things like that) is more trouble
than it is worth?
In particular, should it be flushed in favor of a two line mode line at
the bottom, more like the editor?  This can probably manage to be mouse
sensitive also for the new mail case.  It would also be used in place of
the pop-up mini-buffers when they aren't under a window.
