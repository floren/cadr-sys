    System 86.62, ZMail 45.6, microcode 148,  , on Lisp Machine Eight:
    Have a look at my xmail file, OZ:<AGRE>AGRE.XMAIL.  It was created using
    the O command in Rmail on AI, and Zmail doesn't seem to be able to read
    it in: it tries to add 1 to nil when you say Move to File, select Find
    File, and type CR at OZ:PS:<AGRE>AGRE.XMAIL, which is the default it
    offers.  I believe that this is a long-standing bug that has to do with
    a disagreement between several mail-reading programs over whether the
    inter-message delimiter contains a CR or not; apparently Zmail expects
    one but Rmail doesn't provide it.  This is a great source of grief to
    me and I wish someone would fix it.

Your problem isn't that anyone disagrees.  Basically, it is that RMAIL
doesn't run on tops-20.  For that reason, a tops-20 file cannot be an
rmail file, in zmail's way of automatically figuring out what format a
file is.  Since there are so many programs that grew up independently,
ZMail has enough troubles guessing right for files written by bona fide
tops-20 programs.

What you want to do is convert this file to Babyl format.  To do this,
use the M-X Select Arbitrary Format Mail File command in ZMail, specify
that file and Rmail as the format.  Then go into Profile mode and select
File Options.  You want to change the Format from Rmail to Babyl.  It will
crunch for a while, and then you can save it out.

I don't know if this has been answered or not.  If not, the answer is
that ZMAIL doesn't expect RMAIL files to live on TOPS-20, since RMAIL
doesn't run there.  You can read it in with M-X Select Arbitrary Format

I saw in the response to someone who sent mail to Bug-NWS that this list
is no longer used.  However, Bug automatically generates mail to this
list if you click on "Window System".  The software should be consistent
with the policies.  I once tried to mail to that list, and it died
because AI wasn't up at the time.

How about a profile option that allows me to set my "From" field, so
that replies to my messages will get sent to Multics no matter where I
am logged into.

I know that I should be happy with what I got in terms of my suggestions

that you make prompting for the subject (not requiring it) the default

O'LispM?

    As an artifact of when it used to be on MC, my ZMAIL init specifies
    GMSGS options.  When I try running ZMAIL Get New Mail on EE it bombs out
    in the middle because EE doesn't respond to the GMSGS.  It should keep

In newer systems there is an option you can put on your Babyl file to
get GMSGS from some other host.  With the new error system, you also
don't get thrown out of Get New Mail.

    How about a profile option that allows me to set my "From" field, so
    that replies to my messages will get sent to Multics no matter where I
    am logged into.
You can easily do this with templates in newer systems.
Essentially, the *DEFAULT-CC-LIST* mechanism has been arbitrarily extended.

    I know that I should be happy with what I got in terms of my suggestions
    some time ago abount Subject fields.  However, I would like to ask again

How do others feel about this?  Would :INIT be the correct default?
The mail system I use most of the time deals with subjectless messages just as well,
so I don't personally care.

Get New Mail?  Do you mean click left on Get New Mail, or
did you click Right on Get New Mail and give it your
BABYL file?  The Get New Mail command is not what you
use to start editing a different BABYL file.  It is
what you use to add the new mail (the "inbox") to the
BABYL file you're already editing (or your default one
if you're not).  This has been changed in the next system
to be less confusing.

What you want to use is Select File.  Click right on it,
and choose the Find File option.  You can use Profile mode
to cause these additional mail files to show up directly on
the Select File menu if you desire.  There is a new Zmail
document which has been written, and which is being prepared
for printing now, which will help with some of this stuff.
Also, a number of commands and features are being renamed to
make them easier to understand.

No.  The general paradigm is for mouse action to depend on what you're

double-clicking is obsolete.)  Zmail 64 has Forward bound to

I meant that it would work only while piting at "Mail", as click-middle
does for me with "Reply".    When you say double-clicking has been
obsoleted, do you mean the concept or simply that we need to shift-mdify

Include the :BUG-REPORTS item in the DEFSYSTEM for your system.

I.e. 

(DEFSYSTEM APIARY
  (:BUG-REPORTS "Apiary" "Report a bug in the Apiary software.")
  ...)

The first element is what appears on the menu, the second is what appears
on the mouse documentation line when you move the mouse over that item.

Perhaps there should be a defined interface to the Bug menu other than
the :BUG-REPORTS DEFSYSTEM option, for people who aren't using
DEFSYSTEM.  I don't have anything against DEFSYSTEM, but it seems as if
this level of subroutine ought to exist, so that if DEFSYSTEM had been a
user-written utility, the author of DEFSYSTEM could have had a clean way
into Zmail.

MC never asks for a password, so it must have been OZ.

It did print out which machine it was talking about, overwrote it
before you could see it.  This stuff has been redone in 218.

        I liked our former practice of keeping headers as clean as
        possible by default.  I think that most people probably prefer
        not to have In-reply-to fields generated automatically.

    I agree.
------------

If the theory is that In-Reply-to is for a program, then I dont mind
the extra header line being where (for example) ZMAIL could find it,
as long as I dont have to look at it.  I think BABYL should put in
In-Reply-to fields, but have a switch which needs to be turned on if
the user wants to see them.

This sounds like a hardware bug, not a ZMAIL bug.
Normally the run bar does not completely stay on, with
no paging or flickering, unless something is wrong, such
as looping in the scheduler or microcode, or a hardware failure.

When I go into Zmail and try to report a Zmail bug via M-X Bug, after I specify
Zmail for the bug destination, I get:

>>ERROR: Cannot coerce ("ZMAIL" VALUE "ZMAIL" DOCUMENTATION ...) into a string.
While in the function STRING-LENGTH  STRING-APPEND  ZWEI:PARSE-BUG-ARG

STRING-LENGTH:
   Arg 0 (STRING):  ("ZMAIL" VALUE "ZMAIL" DOCUMENTATION ...)


However, this bottoms out: the bug in Zmail that I originally wanted to report
is this: sometimes I log in on a Lisp Machine, run Zmail, go away for ten
hours, and come back and find that my environment has been left exactly as I
left it, except that someone else has logged in in the meantime.  I say
"Whoopee!" thinking that I won't have to read in all those files again.

Unfortunately, if I have read my mail from somewhere else in the meantime,
however, when I log in again and try to run Zmail, it pukes on me, saying,
"File PGS.BABYL has changed, you will lose."  Well, this is a losing user
interface.  It should say something like, "Since you last read your mail,
someone wrote a new version of your Babyl file on disk, etc., Read in the new
version?"

can't debug it because the pop-up window doesn't let me into the
debugger.

Then I got a NIL to LINE-BLANK-P.

I went into the editor to report all this lossage with m-X bug.  As I
was editing, the editor got an error.  I figured I'd c-M it.  That threw
me into the cold-load stream and completely wedged the window system so
I had to warm-boot.  Hypothesis: c-M never works when you are already in
the editor.  I don't particularly want to test this.

By going into peek (bad user interface -- why isn't there a This Window
system menu item DEBUG?) I got this backtrace for the zmail problem.
This happens repeatedly 15% of the way through my mail file, which I
copied to <zvona.stuff>losing-mail._zmail_txt.

Why does c-M think it knows how many stack frames to include in the
report?  The last time I tried it, it was wrong.

Why is point put at the end of the text in a c-M, rather than at the
begginning?  This encourages people to put their text there, which is
presumably not where you want to see it.

    Why isn't there a This Window system menu item DEBUG?
Because you don't debug windows, you debug processes.  However, the usual
try-to-find-a-process-for-this-window mechanism could be used.  I think
this would be a good thing; any opinions?

    Why does c-M think it knows how many stack frames to include in the
    report?  The last time I tried it, it was wrong.
Have you any suggestions as to how it could know?  A good heuristic would be
nice if anyone could suggest one.  Putting in all frames doesn't seem like
a good idea since there can be a LOT of frames under some circumstances.
We might want to just increase the number.

    Why is point put at the end of the text in a c-M, rather than at the
    begginning?  This encourages people to put their text there, which is
    presumably not where you want to see it.
Yes, this is scheduled to be fixed, along with a prompt asking the user
to report what was going on when the bug came up.

In system 218, you need to use templates, which are not documented.
To get From: in the headers to start, like the *DEFAULT-CC-LIST*, modify

I have  quite a few filters and mail files which I use in zmail.  These would be
easier to cope with if they were displayed in alphabetical order.  Perhaps
mail files should be displayed the same way buffers are in zmacs.  That is, with
filename1 being the first part of the string.  I find that this makes identifying
the buffer you want much easier.  Also, this would make sense if mail files were
to be presented alphabetically.

I sometimes have messages which begin with an indented reply, but
sometimes I put a line containing only whitespace and dashes ("-")
before it.  The subject line in the summary window shows "--------".
I would like it if ZMAIL started hacking the subject line after
ignoring preceeding dash-lines.

In my example (this letter) the subject line would have been parsed as
"Mumbledefrotzenjammerflorpgasnipsdrawkcab", since there is no
explicit Subject and there's none in the yanked message either.

The Defsystem and Zmail features which let you specify things to send

bug reports.  I have systems whose bugs should go to mailing lists
whose names are unrelated to the system's name.

    So put bug-foosys= random-mailing-list in the mailing list database.

Mostly I am concerned about routing bug reports to the correct host,
but if we specify the host, why not the entire address?

If people import a new user system, they have to update their site's
mailing list database to include a bug-report forwarding entry.  If
the feature I suggested were available, implementors could do the work
for them by decalring it in the Defsystem.

Is there some reason I am missing why this feature is a bad idea?

    Re:   META BUG BUG NOTE

    BUG-LISPM sends to a program someplace, which records the entire large
    bugnote in a file, and assigns the note a unique number with which to
    refer to it. This program then SUMMARIZES the bugnote in some way,
    and sends the summary notification to interested parties, the old
    distribution list.

If unique numbers are imbedded in messages, it would be really neat
if when you try to reply to a (bug) message which someone else has
already answered, if your fancy mail reader would give you a

	So put bug-foosys= random-mailing-list in the mailing list database.

    Mostly I am concerned about routing bug reports to the correct host,
    but if we specify the host, why not the entire address?

    If people import a new user system, they have to update their site's
    mailing list database to include a bug-report forwarding entry.  If
    the feature I suggested were available, implementors could do the work
    for them by decalring it in the Defsystem.

    Is there some reason I am missing why this feature is a bad idea?
Since the routing for BUG-FOOSYS would depend on the individual site,
it would be wrong to put it in the DEFSYSTEM.

A couple of weeks ago I asked how to arrange things so that my From
and/or Reply-to fields would always be Margolin@Multics, and the
response suggested templates.  At the time, the machines I used were
running system 210, which did not have these, so I never did anything
about this.  Now that I use System 222, where can I find information
about creating templates.  I was hoping to find something in the PROFILE
option of ZMAIL, but there wasn't anything.

I have been having trouble, from time to time, reading tennex mail files
into zmail.  The reason maybe that an extra blank preceding the message
delimiter is somehow inserted into the mail file.  Zmail is not smart
enough to recognize this problem: It should be because babyl is babyl to
handle these cases.

Zmail insists on having control over loading its profile, because this
loading needs to be interlocked.  You can use (ZWEI:PRELOAD-ZMAIL) as
documented in the release notes.

I got the error "Character 0 not in font TIMESROMANMIT10".  Fine so far.
The real problem is that when the error occurs, you get a notification
that "ZMAIL Background wants to type out".  By the time you can select
it, the CHAOS connection to the DOVER has timed out and you lose your
printout.

    I am a computer science major at Yale, am in my junior year, and was

any ideas?  Note: I have a French Passport, so working papers are no problem.
I would be eager to send my resume anywhere, anytime.

I clicked on get new mail.  I can't understand why this happened.
I tried fs:close-all-files and it bombed out again with the

Doesn't the NES have the capability to know where to send bug reports based on
the type of error and/or what program is involved?
Control-M in the debugger tried to send this to bug-lispm (I guess because
it looked like a generic chaos problem).

sends "Cerberus the Snitch" messages about people it flushes; apparently they

If zmail is going to provide me with a default, then it should
merge in defaults.  I typed O in Zmail in 91.34 and was told the default was
oz:Src:<hdt.mail.people>marty.xmail
  I typed in pgs <return>

Probably in both systems,...
 When I have the mouse positioned over some command like move or select, I frequently
plan to do that same command a number of times, and expect that command to remain the default.

However, if I conjure up an extended version of a particular command, such as 
Move, I almost certainly will have to move the mouse to select a buffer or file or
whatever a newly created window will want me to do.

  When the operation is done, my mouse is then left in some new 
position, which is absolutely worthless except in relation to the temporary
window which has just gone away.  I would very much perfer it if my mouse
would be returned to its original position after I am done using it to
answer some intermediate questions in a popup window.

    If zmail is going to provide me with a default, then it should
    merge in defaults.  I typed O in Zmail in 91.34 and was told the default was
    oz:Src:<hdt.mail.people>marty.xmail
      I typed in pgs <return>
    and the message got moved to oz:src:<hdt.mail.people>pgs.LISP  
    I expected that it should finish the merging of defaults (both directory and file type).
This works properly in Rel 4.  It's not a Zmail bug.

Sorry, I guess that last zmail patch didn't compelely work. (see below)

Control-M is STILL trying to send this to bug-lispm.

A example of another case where relative mouse position isn't
being preserved correctly is clicking on configure (twice).

Anyway, what I did to get this was clicked right on Get New Mail and
typed in my file oz:src:<hdt.mail.subjects>bug-lispm.xmail.2 
It died at 1%.

To: bug-zmail at MIT-OZ


My zmail wedged last nigte, and I couldn't gobble my new mail.

Zmail seemed to be writing out oz:ps:<hdt>hdt.babyl.91 forever.

I just did a directory listing, and the file is 1201 blocks long,
and is apperently a concatenation of my inbox file.

There probably isn't enough state left around for anything more to be found it,
but you might want to know that things like this can happen.

I don't like the fact that the two cc's are seperated, as I don't see
it all in the default two lines of header.  [What's the variable that
controls that?]  I think that like headers should be grouped together.

From a previous session, I had a mail._zmail_ file lying around, as well
as my normal mail file.  I only had my mail._zmail_ file snarfed when I
started up my ZMail, instead of having it then noticing that new mail
has arrived (I would suspect also that if new mail arrives in your inbox
while you are reading in the renamed inbox, it won't get read as well).

    I would rather have the old style-window for sending mail.  I prefer
    to have the headers in a separate window.  The new set-up does not let
    me see where the text should begin, as does BABYL or the (MAIL)

This is controlled by a profile option.  The new mode is the default
because it is faster, but all the old alternatives are still available.

1.  I have reply mode set to Two-windows.  When I do a reply, I get (a) a much
larger (occupies a larger poriton of the screen) headers window than I used to
(b) often all I see of the headers window is the tail end of the In-reply-to
line; the cursor seems to be placed at the end of the headers window, and then
the window is centered around the cursor.  This is bad, because I can't see the
headers at all without mousing the window and redisplaying it.

2.  I have default mail configuration set to normal.  I really like the --Text
follows this line-- line, but the cursor is placed at the end of the buffer,
rather than at the end of the "To:" line (which would be more convenient).
Also, since I have require-subjects set to 'BUG, it doesn't seem like I should
defaultly have a subject line included in the headers section of plain old
mail.

I think GMSGS is a wonderful thing that Oz needed for a long time, and it
works, and it's great, but for the life of me, I can't get the server to work
at all.  Ian, could you and RMS please, please get together and make it work
from a Lisp Machine, and verify that it works from a Lisp Machine?  Please?  I
mean, you wrote the server so that people could use it from a Lisp Machine, and
all your work is just going to go to waste if people can't use it, right?

I run GMSGS from Zmail, specifying /forum as other switches, and my Lisp
Machine hangs in Chaosnet input forever.  I looked in other people's Zmail
inits, and no one else seems to be running gmsgs, presumably because of the
same problem.

Ian determined that the problem with GMSGS is that the Lispm side and he
disagree about protocol.  He implemented what he thought was the protocol you
(RMS) asked for, which is a full connection, with the user sending args in the
first data packet.  However, the Lisp machine end seems to be sending the args
in the RFC.  Anyway, he thinks that you probably have an idea of what his end
wants in the way of protocol; it's just a matter of implementing it.

In the symbolics version of zmail (if not both versions) 
sorting a message file does not mark it as modified.  Thus,
saving a file after sorting it can result in a notification
that no changes have been made and no updating is necessary.
Doesn:t this seem a mistake?

What I wanted was a quick way of forwarding a message, as I usually don't
want to edit the text of a message that I am forwarding.  Just reading in

I did meta-x bug in zmail just now.  I'm glad the defaults were fixed up

I have been getting pestered by mail file lossage lately.
The problem is that these headers:

don't necessarily start on a new line.

The lisp machine should be smart enough to figure out such lossage, and
do the right thing.  

Xmailr maintainers should fix this forthwith.  I hate having to pick through
50 or 60 blocks of mail by hand because of this sort of silly lossage!

In ZMAIL in Experimental MIT-Specific 18.1, Experimental System 93.24,
Experimental ZMail 49.9, microcode 226, gc@2, on Arthur Dent:

If you want my opinion, I think you picked the wrong mail mode when you
decided that there should only be one style of mail sending buffer.  It
is too easy to screw up the "--Text..." line, which will confuse ZMail.
The old ZMail frame was clear, and it didn't depend on the user knowing
that the "Text Follows This Line" was anything more than an instruction
to him, when in actuality the editor depended upon it being there.  If
the user accidentally changes even ONE character on that line he is
screwed unless he can reconstruct it (assuming he figures out that this
is the problem).  And the error message doesn't really point him to the
real problem, as it just says "Can't grok headers: line without a colon"
[is "grok" really a good word in an error message?], which says nothing
about any special line.

If there is a variable that controls whether you get old-style or
new-style mail buffers, then I partially apologize for this flaming.
However, I think the default setting should be changed, then.

Other gripes: C-X A (Add More Text) doesn't work anymore in ZMail Mail
buffers.  Also, the various header hacking commands should be bound to
keys in ZMacs Mail buffers.  Those of us with little minds demand some
consistency here! 9-Mar-83 16:34:47-EST,689;000000000000

on Lisp Machine Five:

If you are reading this in zmail, your subject line probably will say
on Lisp Machine Five:   I have 6 messages in a row in my zmail file that 
all say on Lisp Machine Eightneen: in the sujbject, have 12-14 lines
apiece, and are all different.  BTW, is there know, or will there be,
a quick command for merging a bunch of messages into one (and then
deleting the extra messages)?

Please note that my zmail init is loaded, and I am using the
configuration that was the default about a month ago (with the screen
divided into two main areas, and a menu in the middle), and use the mail
sending mode that is supposed to be most efficient (it uses the part of
the screen where it normally displays the current message).

If I put the mouse in the upper left hand corner of the zmail screen
(right to the left of the topmost number and to the left of the No.
Lines stuff) and so that it partly intersects the horizontal line that
is there, the mouse documentation says change layout to display just
message and the mouse cursor points down, as opposed to the old, useful
behavior.

When I tried to send this message early this morning, something weird
happened, that I haven't been able to duplicate, but was upsetting
enough that I'm complaining.  I was at some particular message in the
buffer and I went to do a bug report (I had to try control-meta-x bug
instead of meta-x bug for some reason).  I typed in a fair amount of
text, and decided I wanted to look at another message while in the
middle of sending the bug report.  I didn't notice a change, and hitting
abort again produced the message Abort is not a recognized.. (or
whatever, as this is indeed from memory, the original mail now lost).
I then noticed that what had apparently happened was that the current
message in my zmail buffer had somehow gotten replaced by the mail I was
in the process of sending.

I like the continue command in the zmail command menu, but there are
times when I would prefer simply converting all of the stuff in programs
in zmail into *mail-n* buffers instead.  And while we're on that topic,
I think that the *mail-n* buffers should have something useful as part
of their name (and still start with *mail) so that I can tell them apart
when listing my buffers, and still have some chance of completing
winningly.  21-Mar-83 22:06:28-EST,2565;000000000000

In ZMAIL in MIT-Specific 18.1, System 93.32, ZMail 49.13, microcode 226,
Yow!  Winning away!, on Lisp Machine Eight:

A couple of things:

(my configuration is message-only)

1>The most important is selection. After sending mail, I am left with a
blank pane marked "Message." Hitting keys (e.g. "M") does the right
thing though.

Typing clear-screen displays the message, but leaves "no selected
window" in the who-line. Mousing any window blanks the message pane
again and puts it in the behaviour above.

2> I sent a message To "nonth-floor" and Cc "Bug-hardware." The machine
barfed that nonth-floor was not a valid address. I fixed the name and
re-sent it.

Did Bug-hardware get it twice? Would they have had they been in the To
field? It would be nice if, after sending mail, I got some notification
such as "Queued via MC" or "Delivered at OZ," depending on the
addresses. If there were multiple addresses, I'd like "a@sail, b@CMU:
Queued via MC"; "BAR@OZ Sucessfully delivered via OZ." 

Also, if it partially won, perhaps it could prompt for an alternate
address, so it  could only resend it to the sites for which it lost.

3> I moused MAIL-right, BUG-left, and it beeped "No default for this
yet." It should share ZWEI's bug default.

Insert your description of the circumstances here:

It should be bound to user-id! I did system-m for a zmail. the nmachine
was fresh; I had not run ZMAIL. I clicked RIGHT on "Get New Mail" to
read from another mail file. It loaded my init, then 0% of my babyl
file, and then bombed:

(Had I wanted it to load my babyl file I would not have clicked right on
"Get New Mail!")

LMFS 30.26, site configuration 19, on Lisp Machine Apiary-2:

Mucho trouble with Zmail lately. One symptom I get is when reading
my mail file it announces "Process Zmail Background got an error" and 
Terminal-0-S pops up a window with just the text "a number" -- is something
using CHECK-ARG incorrectly? I can't get a backtrace on it, sorry.
Also sometimes I get "The argument to PLUSP, NIL, should have been a number".
Will try to investigate more.

If I end up now moving mail to yet other file names while in zmail, when I get
the menu from select the pathnames don't jibe aesthetically.
 What I mean is that some names print out like filename <directory-spec>
while others print out like <directory-spec>filename which is confusing.

This hairy bug occurred as I tried to read my mail using Zmail. Normally I
log in directly to OZ and read my mail there. 

1) Is it possible to specify in a zmail.init file to read MAIL.TXT, not STRAZ.BABYL?
2) Shouldn't it look for a MAIL.TXT anyway in case it doesn't find a STRAZ.BABYL?
3) I'm not logged into OZ in any other fashion (no supdup or tn) right now.

I moused move to find file. It prompted for a filename in a minibuffer.
I typed one, END, and then C-abort. It de-exposed the pop-up menu, but
not the minibuffer. I could type commands to ZMAIL. The summary window
would getr updated, but not the message pane (the minibuffer was over it
and the command-menu).

The preceding line is a header from a piece of mail I received on
header-people.  Of course, Zmail didn't understand the date format, so
when I sorted my mail chronologically, it appeared first, before mail
from last January.

Testing out the time parser of the lisp machine shows that UT is the
unrecognized part of the date/time string, and that by replacing the UT
with GMT things work fine.  I'm going to fix this in the LispM time
parser to understand this new format, but you just might want your mailer to
do something reasonable with this header too.

In zmail, after having been using zmail for I while, I tried to get new
mail.  Everytime, it would just read in 1% of the mail._zmai.. file and
show me the first message.  However, if I were to type N, it would read
in more of the file and show me the next message.  When there were no
more new messages, zmail then went and renumbered the incoming messages
correctly, and closed the file.  This is a c-m-b during the middle of
manually reading in my new file.   I copied old file to something
obvious like ps:<hdt>mail._lose_

on Lisp Machine Twenty-five:

When I do an M or an R in Zmail (I use the quick same-window type of mail), I
get my headers at the top of the window, then one or two blank lines, then the
"--Text follows this line--" line; for example:

-----

To:  PGS@MIT-OZ
Subject: 8th floor concentrator
In-reply-to: The message of 21 Apr 83 10:43-EST from FLECK at MIT-OZ


--Text Follows This Line--

The two blank lines are just empty and useless space, and I always delete them.
They don't strike me as useful.  If I want to add a subject line or whatever, I
can use C-O or a return.  I'd be happier if they weren't there.

I was in the simplest mailing mode, editing the text of a message in the
Message window.  I wanted to type out a message whose summary appeared in the
summary window, so I moused it, and clicked right.  Unfortunately, there is no
Type choice for the summary window.  So, I moved the mouse away, and the
message window put me into viewing the current message before I started sending
the one I was composing.  I was able to continue editing the message with the C
command.30-Apr-83 19:43:37-EDT,2364;000000000000

It appears that the compiled and source versions of this file have the
same name by default (under unix).  After compiling the file, I
subsequently asked to edit the file and got a buffer full of funny
characters.  Is this correct behavior?  I found it confusing.

I would like to have my Zmail init file compiled. If I use the compile option
in the Profile editor, it compiles my Zmail.Lisp file to Zmail.Init instead of 
Zmail.Qbin. This is a loss, especially since I want to run Zmail also on the 3600
where it requires Bin files, and will try to eat the same Zmail.Init file. 
I made a Zmail init file that just loads <Henry>Zmail but then the Profile
editor can't find the source in Zmail.Lisp.

M in Zmail (I use the short form of mail, with a --Text follows this line--

"--Text" line.  This wastes screen space and just looks sloppy.

I recently changed the order in which mail is added to my mail file on
MC.  I also changed my Babyl file to reflect this change (so that inside
Babyl I wouldn't notice any difference, I was only interested in having
newest messages at the front of my mail file).  Babyl handled this just
fine.  I find that ZMail has a glitch however.  It shows me the newest new
message first (for a while) and then it spontaneously discovers its
mistake and reorders my mail file now correctly displaying the oldest
new message.  (Perhaps this is the price I pay for being one of those
losers who keep his mail files arranged in reverse chronological order
of blocks in forward chronological order...)

BTW, The mouse documentation of the mail option, left button, claims it
is "Compatible Mail".  Compatible with what I asked?  Certainly not a
very self-explanitory name in any case...

Zmail has no choice but to read the mail in the order it is stored in the file.
It shows you the mail while it is reading it.  So the order then is wrong.
Reversing and seeing the mail before it is all read in are incompatible.
I don't see what else it could do.

If it is going to show me a message and then rip it out from under my
nose just as I am about to do something to it (like reply to it), and if
it is going to mark the message as seen even though I might not have
been facing my terminal during the 10 seconds it was on the screen, that
is poor behavior.

I would prefer if it wouldn't not show me anything until it knows which
message I want to see first.  I can live with the pause before seeing
the first message, since my choice seems to be to look at something
bogus for equally as long.

OZ incompatibility.  There is no newline at the end of the message.
Since what it does is strictly speaking correct (there isn't a newline
in the byte count) and other programs don't break, the OZ mail
maintainers have refused to change it.

Zmail has since been fixed to deal with this properly.  There is a
(unofficial) patch file for release 4 that should fix the problem.
However, since no one runs release 4 here and no one volunteered to test
it 3 months ago when I made the file and people other than myself did
run release 4, I don't feel right in making it a system patch and
breaking things.

    Is there an easy way to recover from such lossage except by manually
    editing ones Babyl file?

    When FOO is bound to an extant string, 
      (with-output-to-string (standard-output foo)
	 (stuff))
    is supposed to return the value of (stuff), for the output is in foo.

Indeed, that is what the GreyNual says.  Changing the macro expansion to
figure out whether to use PROGN or PROG1 sounds like the right solution,
is you want to conform to the documentation.  If you don't, you could
use multiple-value-prog1.  I'm much too tired to understand the possible
implications of this and make a patch.

Two of them.

One, when yanked headers in a reply are pruned, there ought to be a
space between the headers and the yanked text.

Two, it would be nice if there were a way to specify "all these
recipients mean me."  That way, mail to "GUMBY@MC" and "GUMBY@XX" and
"...!mit-vax!gumby" would all show the same way in the survey window.
Also, I could then look for this and filter out messages just to me.

Cc: cory at dspg

In ZMAIL in Release 4.4, site configuration 71, happy days!, on Lisp Machine Tweety Pie:

The problem I had mentioned about local mail headers not being parsed
properly was caused by the fact that our /bin/mail program was not
putting two spaces after the user name in the from lines.  That is, the
old /bin/mail did this:
"From <user> <date>"
I replaced it with a new version that does this:
"From <user>  <date>"
Which is what zwei:parse-unix-header expects.
This problem was not seen with outside mail because such messages have
an arpa From: header that supplies the information that can't be
extracted from the unix header line.

That fixed the problems for us, but other unix systems may have similar
problems.

I believe 4.1bsd inserts two spaces, but most 11's and perhaps standard
bell systems may have trouble.

    It would be nice to have mouse commands which flipped to the next and previous month
    display.  A "mid-month" mode which displayed the last half of this month and the first half
    of the next might be a nice feature also.
CMB has proposed five-week mode in which you can scroll the weeks.
This will probably be available in release 6.

I've had a friend help me out.

The "mph@mit-xx:" instead of "mph@MIT-XX:" does indeed seem to indicate
that the mailer didn't notice the host name.  It would help if I could see the
queue file.   Does ZMAIL write the queue file itself or does it connect to
OZ using the MAIL protocol?

If you could catch me on-line sometime,  I'd like to try grabbing the queue
file before the mailer gets at it.

microcode 257, ZM MIT, on Lisp Machine Thirty-one:

When I get new mail in Zmail, this happens.  I have an init file that tells
zmail to get my mail from MC and run gmsgs on OZ.  Looks like parse-host isn't
being done on gmsgs-host.

Also, in the Zmail profile screen, all the mouse-selectable little boxes with
words in them seem to have moved up, or maybe the words moved down.  In any
case, the bottoms of the words are obscured by the bottoms of the boxes.  This
may be affected by the (set-default-font 'medfnt) I have in my init file,
although it worked in 94.

In ZMAIL in System 97.6, CADR 1.0, ZMail 51.2, MIT-Specific 21.0,
microcode 257, ZM MIT, on Lisp Machine One:

When getting new mail my ZMAIL.INIT file is loaded, then my
babyl mail file OZ:PS:<EB.TFC>EB.TFC.BABYL is read,
then my inbox file MAIL.TXT.1 begins to be read.

However, at some time after this point something goes wrong.
The first message in my MAIL.TXT file is displayed, but
the LispM continues to run perpetually. It continues to
display the Run message in the bottom of the screen until
I type C-Abort at which time the rest of the files in my
EB.TFC.BABYL file are dislayed and the message in the
MAIL.TXT file is displayed TWICE in the summary window
at the top of the ZMAIL window.

At one point while farting around with this trying to get
it to work (on a 3600) I got a message that said that my
inbox buffer was out of sync and to get a wizard.

The problem only occurs when reading from my inbox. I have
had the same problem on several LispMs.

This may be a problem in the file system, but in the event
that it isn't I could give you a description of my ZMAIL.INIT
and .BABYL files in nauseating detail.

Just when I thought it was safe to go back in my mailbox...

I've found at least two ways ZMAIL doeasn't like the new system:

When it runs GMSGS it gets an error (the option to run GMSGS is in my
ZMAIL.INIT file) that barfs: ERROR DURING GMSGS TO HOST MIT-OZ
HOST WENT INTO AN OPEN STATE INSTEAD OF AN ANSWERED STATE or some
such.

When it reads in my MAIL.TXT file it formats the summary window
entries according to the specifications in my ZMAIL.INIT file. However
when it reads in my BABYL file it disregards the init specs and
displays the BABYL entries in the vanilla way.

From the sources I can find, zmail has always believed that gmsgs is a byte stream
protocol, not a datagram protocol.  There was a short period during which OZ had
a datagram gmsgs server.  Perhaps there is some patch whose lifetime has expired?

Your babyl file overrides the default from your zmail.init.

In ZMAIL in Release 4.5, site configuration 75,
Apiary Simulator Tested & Current: 22 September 1983, on Lisp Machine Apiary-3:

Several suggestions/complaints:

  Why doesn't the summary pane (headers) include a FANCY-SCROLLING-MIXIN?
  This functionality would be warmly welcomed.

Regarding the calendar...

  The calendar would be a wonderful feature if it worked.  The document
  that I looked at did not document it at all, how do I get messages to
  show up on the calendar?  I could put then on the first time but
  couldn't read them back in at the next session.  I got thrown into
  the cold-load-stream more than once, so I simply gave up.  Sorry about
  not sending in a bug report, but I had a meeting to go to when the
  errors occured (one after the other). 

Granted that this is nothing new, but... 

  Why does the summary pane jossle about so much during [Get Inbox]?
  It seems to be all confused.  It would be much more desirable if it
  would not display anything (or an incomplete list) until it got its
  act together.  This is one of my main resons for not liking Zmail.
  Babyl is considerably faster and far less distracting while it is
  reading things in.

In my init file I tell my Lisp Machine about my prefered font, CPTFONTB, using
TV:SET-DEFAULT-FONT.  There are not too many programs that refuse to use this
font, and the ones that do usually have some good reason.  ZMAIL however
appears to be inconsistent on this matter.  In most of its windows it uses the
default font, but in windows that are used to compose ordinary mail or to make
replies (ZMAIL-WINDOWs), it insists on using CPTFONT.  Why does this happen?
Is this a bug?

Insert your description of the circumstances here:

I quite often get this bug.
I had a zmail buffer for oz:ps:<daniel.g.mly.l>bug-lispm.babyl, and had done
  a lot of changes to it.
I sent mail to the inbox <daniel.g.mly.l>mail.txt associated with this babyl file
  [one message] whilst all this was happening
Later in zmail, I typed g to get new mail.
The summary window displayed the new message at the bottom of the summary window,
  with a "1:"
Then... disaster strikes!!! [I did NOT touch the keyboard whilst all this was happening]
Saved babyl file in <daniel.g.mly.l>losing-babyl.babyl

I just used Zmail ONLY to sort a mail file.  I selected the file, sorted
it, and asked to save it.  Zmail told me that the file didn't need to be
written because it hadn't changed.  Something needs to be told that the
sort command DOES modify the file.

1)  The system should allow you to go back and modify your

2)  It shouldn't break when you try to do it.

3)  Breakage should be repairable -- i.e., it shouldn't break

I use one-window mode in ZMAIL.  I moused SURVEY to get a list of
messages in the current collection, and moused middle on one of the
lines to delete that message.  This never did work, but before rel 5 it
used to do nothing (if that's any help).

In ZMail in Release 4.5 on PA Lisp Machine Merlin (3600):

After moving many messages from my main Babyl file to 
an XMail file, I typed S and it saved all files. Then I
realized I really like the XMail file sorted by date.
So I sorted it and typed S again. I am positive that the
message order changed, yet ZMail claimed that no changes
needed to be written. I had to type c-R Space Rubout End
to convince it that it really wanted to save that file.

To: BUG-BETA-TEST@MIT-OZ

In BUG-BETA-TEST@SCRC in Release 5.0 [GC'd Beta Test rev 3],
Experimental RELATUS 30.0, dusty plum, on Lisp Machine Apiary-8 (3600):

I have found, through painful experience, that when typeout on the
TYPEIN-WINDOW wraps around (i.e., starts printing on the first line again)
it does a clear screen that also clears the TYPEOUT-WINDOW.  This is
a serious problem for my application, and no doubt a bug in the way
clearing the TYPEIN-WINDOW works.  Code that fixes this temporarily
woudl be greatly appreciated.

If I set these variables:

  *DELETE-EXPIRED-MSGS* T
  *PRESERVE-MSG-REFERENCES-ACROSS-EXPUNGE* T
  *QUERY-BEFORE-EXPUNGE* T

then I get put into an infinite loop being asked if it is OK to delete
expired messages or OK to expunge deleted messages.  Regardless of
whether I answer "yes" or "no", I get the question again and again.

PS. I got "MIT-AI" as the host for the bug report here, so the list is
in the wrong order again somehow.

Yes, yes, yes.  It happens all the time to me.
I think it might involve using the Concat command and having
references preserved across expunging.  It only happens when I do
complicated editing of multiple mail files.

of about 400 lines.  I read some stuff, deleted some stuff, moved one
1300-line file to a buffer and saved it, etc. etc.  I then tried to save
my main mail buffer.  Each time, I had to abort becaus it looked like it
was running way off the deep end -- just before I hit control/abort on
this last time, the little "file out" legend should 1298568 characters.
right.  I tried a zwei:save-all-buffers from lisp.  Hopefully that will
have helped.  i'm gonna re-boot and try again.

    In Release 5.0 [GC'd Beta Test rev 3], Experimental RELATUS 85.0,
    microcode TMC5-MIC 262, dusty plum, on Lisp Machine Robot-4 (3600):

    Maybe I don't know what I'm doing 'cause I never used this facility in zmail
    before, but this shouldn't happen anyway.

I thought it used to be the case that when you hit <help> while typing
the reminder period for a periodic reminder you got the documentation
for how to define the reminder period...  Otherwise, how else can users
find out (there doesn't seem to be a "m-X Describe Command" in ZMail)?

From the documentation for periodic reminders:
"Click middle composes a periodic reminder.  You will be prompted for an expression for
the period.  Currently, this is a list.  Examples of simple valid period expressions:
  (DAY-OF-THE-WEEK FRIDAY)
  (DAY-OF-MONTH FIRST)
  (MONTH MARCH)
  (DAY-AND-MONTH APRIL 2)
  (DAY-OF-WEEK-IN-MONTH NOVEMBER MONDAY SECOND)
  (BASTILLE-DAY)
  (MARDI-GRAS)
  (AND (DAY-OF-THE-WEEK FRIDAY) (DAY-OF-MONTH 13.))
You will be asked to confirm the next occurrence of your period
expression. You are also prompted for an expiration date."

    Also, time-parser should be able to recognize 3:30a = 3:30am and 12p = 12pm

Unfortunately, 3:30a  3:30am and 12p  12pm because "a" and "p" are
military time-zone specifiers.

You mean it should display the time at which the reminder ends?  It
already does display the time at which the reminder starts.

    Zmail doesn't seem to come with the standard temporal filters, like ZBABYL does.

    There should be default filters like from, recent etc. which find reminders

    for: today, yesterday, tommorrow, (random date), before, after, during, (use your imagination)

Where should they appear?  It's trivial for you to define them yourself.
But if they are always there, they must not clutter things up when they
aren't useful.

    You mean it should display the time at which the reminder ends?  It
    already does display the time at which the reminder starts.
Hmmm.  I don't see either display in our rel 5.0.  Anyway, what I was thinking is that it
is nice to be able to glance at the display and imediately see which reminders overlap.  
Maybe a graphic display could hack the overlap problems.  

	There should be an option on the mouse-sensitivity of the particular day to go

It would seem to be a good idea.  Supposing somebody wants to use the calendar
mode to produce schedules for complex activities, a day mode would certainly
be very helpful.  In fact, the day mode would seem to be the place where the
most information can be presented to the user.  It is in the day mode that
detailed planning of schedules must be done simply because it is a relatively
short and convenient unit.  Of course, it would be really neet if day mode
were recursive in a way that it could also be used for smaller intervals!

What about a menu on middle?  Or perhaps buckey bits?  

It might also be a nice init option to have zmail put up a survey of the days
reminders (like Zbabyl).  This might be a problem though because of the time
that it takes to load mail files.  Maybe it should just ask (depending on
whether the option is set or not) after it has loaded the user's mail files
and all.

    The inverse of the concatenation used by zmail.

As you point out yourself, that operation does not have an inverse,
since it had no format from which the end of one message and the start
of another can be deduced.

Let me guess that what you really want is handling of digests, which are
the semi-official means to transmit multiple messages as one.  Newer
versions of zmail do include support for both composing and exploding
standard format digests.

This is very sad, since I set all my seminars and appointments
to have Start-Date of two days before and Expiration-Date of an
hour after the appointment. It means the most important day 
doesn't appear.

The advantage to this is that if I read my mail right after a 
seminar, ZBabyl will not still think the seminar announcement 
is something it should remind me about; in fact, it will offer
to delete the message in that session, rather than forcing me to
wait until the following day.

The only thing I can figure is that the person writing the software
assumed people would only want to use the date part of
Start/Expiration-Date fields and not the time part?

    In ZMAIL in System 242.269, FEP 18, imperial purple, on Lisp Machine Keith Moon (3600):

    In the Main Zmail Window, when the mouse is over Profile the mouse
    documentation line is blank.

I can't immediately verify this on an Imperial Purple band, but on
242.274, Zmail 83.50, the mouse line documentation for Profile reads
"Alter user options and Edit Zmail profile".  So this is definitely
fixed in the eventual Release 5.0 Real.

Since you failed to include any information (such as what the

it will have to remain mysterious!

You must be clicking left on Jump in its initial state.  [Jump(left)]
remembers the last filter used; it is initially undefined.

Read the mouse documentation line at the bottom of the screen.

Try a numeric arg from the keyboard: "J" for beginning of sequence,
"12J" to go to message 12, "ZJ" to go to last message.

Try [Jump(right)] to get a filter menu and see what that gets you.

Read the "Zmail Concepts and Techniques" document (in the Release 4
documentation) for ideas and info.  It's got problems, but it has this
stuff and much more in it.  Improved documents will be coming shortly
with the Release 5 documentation.

Since no one else has said it...

The space up there between the system version and the error text is
reserved for the user.  It's provided so that background on the error
can be jotted down.  This helps both in recreating the error and in

microcode 309, ZM MIT, on Lisp Machine Eighteen:

	I performed the following sequence of operations:

login zzz.rlk

zmail

	It loaded my init file (<zzz.rlk>zmail.init.2), loaded my mail,
	and loaded my babyl file.  It loaded it in reverse order, which
	it is not supposed to do, by the way.

I moused Sort, and clicked left to put the file in correct order.

I deleted message #19, by typing d.

I moved to message #17, moused move, and clicked right.

I moused Generated Temp, and clicked (I don't remember which button)

I typed n, and clicked left on move.  The little window at the bottom
	read Moved to temp.

I repeated this process twice more, so I moved messages #17,18,20,21 to
	temp.

I moused Select and clicked left (window read temp).

	The survey window showed the temporary buffer, with the correct
	4 messages.

I moused map over and clicked middle, which read move;.  The little
	window read "moved to buffers by filter" or something very
	similar, which by the way was not what I intended -- I intended
	a menu (which is not what I intended -- but my init file, which
	I generated with the Profile operation may be at fault).

I moused map over again and clicked right, giving me a menu.

I moused move, and clicked right, giving me a new menu.

I moused hardcopy and clicked right.

I moused do it, as I was satisfied with the parameters (lpt8 font, 1
	copy, new page for each message) and clicked right.

	The machine displayed run in the who-line with the underscore
	flickering from left to right positions, as normal.  The machine
	displayed moved to dover. in the little window, displayed run in
	who-line for another second or so, and then displayed keyboard
	in the who line, with the underscore in the right-hand position.
	At this point the machine froze totally; the mouse, as well as
	the keyboard froze, and the output did not reach the dover.  I
	was then forced to reboot the machine, as C-M-ABORT did not work
	either.  To be certain that it was not a fluke, I performed the
	operation again from the freshly-booted machine, and followed
	essentially the same sequence, with only a few incidental
	changes, which had no effect on the buggaceous operation of the
	machine.

Files:

ZZZ^V.RLK.BABYL.63, 64, 65
ZMAIL.INIT.1 (source)
ZMAIL.INIT.2 (compiled as per the option under profile)
MAIL.TXT.1 (the first time only)
(all on zzz.rlk)

At boot time, a file of microcode errors (so it claimed) for v. 309 was
loaded from <lispm>ucadr.<mumble> or 

It should be noted that earlier in the day I was using ZARNIWOOP to read
my mail, and was having a problem something like mis-synchronization
with inbox file or something.  I tried to fix it by going to ARTHUR, and
I thought that I succeeded.  If I am froced to read my mail again I'll
rename the file in question to MUMBLE.BABYL.  BITNET.BABYL, another
babyl file of mine, did not give me problems.  Zarniwoop, by the way,
runs slimebolics software.

microcode 306, on Lisp Machine One:

Attempting to select a file using select menu option:

my init file gives me two other secondary mail files.  When I tried to
select ccc: mbox /usr/rlk/ (as the item lists) after earlier selecting
oz:<zzz.rlk.bitnet>bitnet.babyl (earlier in the session, it typed out
new file:  ccc: /zzz.rlk.bitnet/mbox /usr/rlk/bitnet.babyl.

Sequence:

login zzz.rlk

zmail startup (read in zzz.rlk.babyl)

select <zzz.rlk.bitnet>bitnet.babyl

select ccc:/usr/rlk/mbox (from menu)

(asks me to login, I type rlk<space> which is my uname at ccc)

types out new file:... as above


When I select from the select menu read a new file and give it
ccc:/usr/rlk/mbox it works fine.  it asks me to login at ccc which I do
the same way as above (rlk<space>) and proceeds to load ccc:
/usr/rlk/mbox, getting any new mail.  It's when I select from the menu
that I have problems.  By the way, when I typed the names in to the
profiler (alternate mail files option) I typed them:

<zzz.rlk.bitnet>bitnet.babyl
ccc:/usr/rlk/mbox

This seems like it may be unclear...perhaps I'll have to show you what
happens.

It would be nice if \ were defined in Zmail.  \ in Babyl fills the current
message text.  It does it in some reasonable fashion so that headers (even
those in inserted messages) don't get filled, and so that indentation is
preserved, presumably by setting the fill prefix.  It would probably not be
hard to implement it for Zmail; just look at the Babyl code.

Gee it would be nice if zmail would allow me to create new mail files without
losing hacking the file job.  I created a new babyl file using the
read-or-create mail file option in mouse-right on select.  When I tried to
write that new babyl file out this is what happened.  

I have reported this bug N times now, where N is approaching infinity.  This
is the kind of basic functionality which makes the lispm look like trash to
the average customer.  Pretty soon everyone here will be using Zbabyl because it
works.

briefly returned, then the window for editing the universe-filter
business returned (the one I had just used).  I made several other
attempts to use this, with various combinations, all of which failed.
By the way, after the windowfor editing the universe first disappeared,
no selected window appeared.  When this window reappeared, the no

In zmail in System 98.40, CADR 3.6, ZMail 53.13, MIT-Specific 22.0,
microcode 309, ZM MIT, on Lisp Machine Eighteen:

I created a temp buffer by selecting some messages from a buffer (I've
had this problem before, and I showed the first part to MLY).  I moused
right map over, clicked reply.  I got a trap(whose name I don't
remember, but I showed MLY), and typed resume (the key) and typed 0
return.

I then aborted (the key) and seelected a message in a different buffer,
at which time I typed c and then did M-x Zmail Yank Current Message.
The message yanked in as intended.  I removed the first four columns
(the spaces) from each line (via global replace), removed the yanked-in
header lines, and aborted, to re-check some of the addresses.

I checked (by searching through the messages in myu temp buffer) and
typed c again.  I began editing the to-fields in the header, but did not
finish.  At one point I neglected to put a comma between addresses (only
a space).  I then aborted.  I received an error (sorry I didn't report;
I could try to duplicate), and typed abort.  The bottom section now held
the proper message, as if in the top level zmail, the middle (from about
15% to 60%) held the aborted message, and the top 15% or so held the
error message.  My commands from the keyboard worked (i. e. n, p, etc.)
but the mouse did not respond properly.  There was no mouse area in the
middle of the screen, nor was there a summary window.  After making
various tries to restore everything to normal (including warm boots,
ends, aborts of various kinds, and continues (c's)) I typed m-x bug.
Oddly (?) enough the summary window was now restored, and I had the
appropriate editor window for sending mail in the bottom of the screen.
I typed c-x 2 to get in 2-window mode, at which point the previous
message I sent takes over.  After sending that message, I was returned
to the debugger, at which point abort merely caused select to appear in
the who-line to the right of USER:.

I probably should try to demonstrate it, as it is rather
complicated-looking to me in terms of what happened.

After sending the previous message, the normal zmail display did not
return.  The bug report stayed.  I typed m-x bug, and the summary window
reappeared, so did the mouse.  This I am sending from standard mail mode
(summary top, mouse middle, mesage lower).  This is similar to what
happened in the description of the first message.

The other one I reported in varying forms this afternoon still exists.
After map over / reply (supplying an argument of 0 when it trapped, as I
reported a few minutes ago), I added "mumble" (no quotes) at the end of
the "to:  " list with no comma.  I then typed abort.  The messages I was
replying to were left in the top window, the middle window contained the
error notification, and the bottom window contained part of the letter
that I was "sending".  Note:  I aborted when in the header window.

After this, the top window responded to spaces, scrolling by pages
(remember, the top window contained what I replied to).  The machine
responded normally to m-x bug.  Now after this I'm going to se if it
responds to m-x configure sort of thing and resets zmail back to normal
state.

Zmail claims that expiration-date: and start-date: headers will not be
transmitted in outgoing mail, and then, aborts transmission.  This should be
fixed for consistency.  Also, it would be nice to have commands like control-X
S to set the expiration-date and start-date headers of outgoing messages.

AHA!  I reproduced the doesn't-save-the-whole-file bug in Zmail.  I
typed s (save) and the machine appeared to go into a loop.  The buffer
was equal to safety.babyl (which you can do anything with after it's
been backed up) on zzz.rlk.  I then deleted about 100 messages and typed
s, at which point the right-hand light under the mode line went on,
flickering in sync with the counting on the clock.  It kept going for
about 30 seconds or so, which seemed much too long, so I C-ABORTed.  I
typed e, and the buffer expunged.  I again typed s, and what looked like
only one message saved.  Now I think about it, something similar
happened last time this occurred.  I'll try demonstrate it if you'd
like.  Again, you can twiddle safety.babyl any time after it's been
backed up.  Now let's try protect myself.

Mis-save happened again.  But I didn't abort out of the save like I said
last night.  But during the initial read-in I did click left on Sort
quite early and got an error, which I aborted from.  Unfortunately I did
not think about it and send a bug report right away.  I always have to
click left on sort because during the initial read-in Zmail reverses the
order of the mail (new mail at the front and reversed date throughout)
even though I explicitly do not want it (and so says my Babyl file).

Note:  the partially-saved Babyl files contain *RECENT* mail only.

Hmm.  It should put you in the composition mode, and allow you to fill in the
To: line of the message.  Perhaps the change in the screen display is not all
that obvious, as only a line has to be inserted.

In ZMAIL in System 98.48, CADR 3.6, ZMail 53.17, MIT-Specific 22.0,
microcode 309, on Lisp Machine One:

So far two people have implied that I didn't know what I was doing.  I
would like to make it perfectly clear that I do and that my problem was
real and not just my inability to recognize what forwarding is supposed
to do.

I just tried it now and it seems to work fine but, what happened on
other occasions was the following: I hit "f" when I was on a message I
wanted to forward.  Serveral times it, instead of adding a message
header and putting the cursor at the end of a blank To: line, it put me
into a recursive edit and put the cursor at the end of the message.

It happens sporadically and never twice for the same message.

This is a real bug; somebody please fix it.

On ITS and Unix, c-Z means to go to the superior, and c-D means what c-Z
does on TOPS-20.  (This includes c-Z in ITS Babyl!  c-C on ITS does what
c-Z does in TOPS-20).  On the lisp machine, there is an END key, and c-Z
picks a lisp window to select.  VMS uses c-Z like tops-20, uses c-Y to
mean what c-C means on TOPS-20, and has c-C mean something somewhat
different.

The character used to mean "END" varies from operating-system
to operating-system, and seldom is related to the individual
piece of mail software.  Clearly, there is no single right
choice about what system to be compatible with.

If we took all the lisp machine users in the world, the "other system"
that this sort of compatibility would be most needed for would probably
be Unix, and would certainly NOT be TOPS-20.  (I am not claiming that's
why it is the way it is).  I think cross-operating-system compatibility
of user-interface is a hopeless morass.

I'm not sure how this differs from what you expected, but here are my
comments on what is in your report:

Your namespace object gives "Hewitt at OZ" as your mail host, so Zmail
goes to OZ to find your mailbox.  Apparently, there was no default mail
file name specified in your Zmail profile, so Zmail uses a default name.
Since OZ is a TOPS-20 system, it uses "OLDMAIL.TXT".  (That default is
new in Release 5; I'm not sure what it may have done in 4.5.)  So that's
why it looks for that file on OZ.

If you want it to default to something else for [Select(L)] or G or [Get
Inbox(L)], click on [Profile] and find the item "File read in at
startup:" in the large menu at the top.  Enter a file pathname
(including host name), and save the profile by clicking on [Save].  Then
it will always default to that mailbox, rather than any system defaults.

Re your other question, the failure to find the file (even if it didn't
exist on OZ) was due to Apiary-7's being unable to make a connection to
OZ.  Was there really no way to recover?  It should have offered a
number of proceed options, including trying again, and trying a
different pathname.

    I'm not sure how this differs from what you expected, but here are my
    comments on what is in your report:

Thanks for your reply: it helps somewhat but I am still having trouble.

    Your namespace object gives "Hewitt at OZ" as your mail host, so Zmail
    goes to OZ to find your mailbox.

Would it be possible to provide more than one entry in my namespace object (like login) so
that if OZ is down, I could temporarily use MC as my mail host?

    Apparently, there was no default mail
    file name specified in your Zmail profile, so Zmail uses a default name.
    Since OZ is a TOPS-20 system, it uses "OLDMAIL.TXT".  (That default is
    new in Release 5; I'm not sure what it may have done in 4.5.)  So that's

If OZ is down then I would like the option to try to connect to another host.

    If you want it to default to something else for [Select(L)] or G or [Get
    Inbox(L)], click on [Profile] and find the item "File read in at
    startup:" in the large menu at the top.

But I don't want to ALWAYS try to read in some specific file when I start up
Zmail!  What I would like to have is a proceed option to tell Zmail where
my ZMAIL-INIT.LISP file lives.

    Enter a file pathname
    (including host name), and save the profile by clicking on [Save].  Then
    it will always default to that mailbox, rather than any system defaults.

    Re your other question, the failure to find the file (even if it didn't
    exist on OZ) was due to Apiary-7's being unable to make a connection to
    OZ.  Was there really no way to recover?

There was no way to recover.

    It should have offered a
    number of proceed options, including trying again, and trying a
    different pathname.

Another problem that I have been having with Zmail is that when the
MC mail server gets overloaded it refuses to accept mail from a 3600.
At that point it is IMPOSSIBLE to send mail form a 3600 even though OZ,
MC, EE, etc. are all up and running ready to accept mail!  The reason
is that NO proceed option is offered for this case.  Of course if MC
should happen to crash at this point then I could send mail because the
3600 will quite happily use OZ, MC, or EE!

[Note: Another thing you might want to change in your profile is on the
question "Prune headers of yanked messages:".  The default is No.  Set
it to Yes, and the various Received, Message-ID and other cluttering
headers are removed in your reply draft.]

        ...
	Your namespace object gives "Hewitt at OZ" as your mail host, so Zmail
	goes to OZ to find your mailbox.

    Would it be possible to provide more than one entry in my namespace object (like login) so
    that if OZ is down, I could temporarily use MC as my mail host?

That would involve changes to the namespace system that are not likely
to happen.  However, Zmail contains within it the means to do what you
want.  See below.

	Apparently, there was no default mail
	file name specified in your Zmail profile, so Zmail uses a default name.
	Since OZ is a TOPS-20 system, it uses "OLDMAIL.TXT".  (That default is
	new in Release 5; I'm not sure what it may have done in 4.5.)  So that's
	why it looks for that file on OZ.

    If OZ is down then I would like the option to try to connect to another host.

Read on.

	If you want it to default to something else for [Select(L)] or G or [Get
	Inbox(L)], click on [Profile] and find the item "File read in at
	startup:" in the large menu at the top.

    But I don't want to ALWAYS try to read in some specific file when I start up
    Zmail!  

Oops.  That's what the question says, but not what it means.  No file is
read at startup without a user command.  (Maybe in the past Zmail used
to start reading a mailbox on its own; today, there is a way to make
Zmail preload files before it is even selected, if you want.  But that's
another matter.)  What the item really does is to define the pathname
that is the default for Select and Get Inbox.  This question is one of
many candidates for improvement in the Profile area.

	    What I would like to have is a proceed option to tell Zmail where
    my ZMAIL-INIT.LISP file lives.

This is a somewhat different matter.  The problem you reported had the
connection to OZ failing on at attempt to probe your mailbox
(OZ:PS:<HEWITT>OLDMAIL.TXT).  Although your Home host is also set to be
OZ, and that defines where Zmail would go to find your profile
(ZMAIL-INIT.BIN or .LISP).

I contend that in either case, there is a proceed option offered (I
think on s-C) to try a different pathname without telling the caller.
But there is a better way for the case of the mailbox.  If OZ is not up,
just abort from the blowout, and [Select(R)].  This will give you a menu
of mail files to select.  Use [Read/Create file] to type in a pathname.

If there is a standard set of mail file names that you want to be in the
Select menu always, whether they are already read in or not, you can
specify this in your profile.  [Profile], then [Mail Files], which will
present a menu of names already on the list and/or in buffers, as well
as a "New" item that you can use to add new names.  Finish this, and
Save the profile, and the specified names will always be included in the
Select menu.

Using these tools, you can quickly pick among alternative mailboxes on
several hosts.


    Another problem that I have been having with Zmail is that when the
    MC mail server gets overloaded it refuses to accept mail from a 3600.
    At that point it is IMPOSSIBLE to send mail form a 3600 even though OZ,
    MC, EE, etc. 
(I assume not MC here...)
		 are all up and running ready to accept mail!  The reason
    is that NO proceed option is offered for this case.  Of course if MC
    should happen to crash at this point then I could send mail because the
    3600 will quite happily use OZ, MC, or EE!

I'm not sure of all the details, but mail transport works quite
differently in Release 5.2, which you will be getting shortly.  I
believe that this kind of thing is fixed in 5.2; similar situations seem
to work well here, among four or five alternative mail servers.  Perhaps
someone else can elucidate this point.

    Uh, yeah, so is this a bug report?
    If so, what is the bug?

    I read this as saying "I clicked on one of the items in the
    zmail variables pane and edited it, and was supprised; I didn't
    know I could do that".  Did you not know that was how you were
    supposed to change them, or did I not understand your description

The latter, but only because I wasn't specific enough.  Actually, I simply
wrote the wrong thing.  What happened was this:  I was allowed to edit the
VARIABLES themselves, not just their values.  I was indeed suprised.

In Symbolics 3600 ZMAIL in Release 5.2, Experimental RELATUS 130.36,
FEP 18, on Lisp Machine Buddy Holly:

I tried to put these headers onto a message and zmail told me that they would
not be transmitted when I hit end.   

Start-date: Sep 19, 1984 at 10am
Expiration-date: September 19, 1984 at 12pm

* Zmail should let me send such headers if I added them by hand.

* Zmail should provide a meta-x command (or something) for adding such
headers to outgoing mail.

I think you are saying that you clicked on something in the LOWER window
in the Zmail profile window, right?  And you could edit any of the text
there, yes?  That is an ordinary Zwei editor window containing the
source of your Zmail-init file.  It is a strange hybrid beast, in that
Zmail creates a block of LOGIN-SETQs of its profile variables at the
head of the file, but you can also create whatever Lisp forms you want
to be there, like filter and template definitions.

In the development system, some promintent comments are inserted around
the automatically generated block, to caution the user of the
significance of editing its contents; one is still free to do it,
though.

Note that the UPPER CVV menu pane is where you can change the
instantiated values of the variables; you can also save those values
permanently by using the Save button.  This upper window also scrolls...

Yes.  In the upper (CVV) pane of the Profile window, find the item
"Default file for initial Get Inbox or Select:", and fill in that file
name with a version number of 1.  (Watch out for transition effects the
first time you start Zmail thereafter.  You'll have to rename version n
to version 1, then Get Inbox.) 

		I guess I think this should be the default, as it is in

This is a point of some controversy.  It probably will remain the same
as it now is (new version each time the file is written out).

Oops.  Your guess is right.  The former wording is my own recent change
for more accuracy.  The specified file is not, in fact, read at startup
(maybe it was long ago); it is the default mailbox for when you do
command one to be read in. 

    By the way, I looked for an option to do this in the File Options for
    x.gyro.babyl, which would perhaps be a more findable place to put it
    than in the middle of this huge CVV.

Maybe, but that's off-by-one-level, because x.gyro.babyl is the default
mailbox to get that you want Zmail to know about, before it ever got the
file, right?  So that's an attribute for the overall Zmail profile.

Note, the File Options of the Babyl file give you a place to specify the
Inbox file from which new mail is gotten and appended to that mailbox
file.

As for the "huge CVV menu", that's a general problem that we're working
on.  It needs to be much better organized, probably by categories, but
also some way to search it for substrings of what you want to find.

To: BUG-ZMAIL at MIT-OZ

In Symbolics 3600 ZMAIL in Release 5.2, NS 19.70, FEP 18, on Lisp Machine Elvis Presley:

The zmail background process bombs out in a call to +-internal passing
an argument of nil.  This happens about 91% of the way through reading
the babyl file in.  Is there a flag I can set so that the background
process errs out rather than automatically restarting?  I've looked at
the file, and it doesn't obviously have trash in it.  There is a message
whose subject line is the single character + at about the right place in
the file, but I'll give everyone the benefit of the doubt about that
one.  Other somewhat unusual text -- some backspaces in a message from
MMCM, and a message with many references (dcp).

I wish I had a way of finding out what the problem was.

    In Symbolics 3600 ZMAIL in Release 5.2, Experimental RELATUS 130.36,
    FEP 18, on Lisp Machine Buddy Holly:

    I tried to put these headers onto a message and zmail told me that they would
    not be transmitted when I hit end.   

    Start-date: Sep 19, 1984 at 10am
    Expiration-date: September 19, 1984 at 12pm

    * Zmail should let me send such headers if I added them by hand.
It will in Release 6.0.

    * Zmail should provide a meta-x command (or something) for adding such
    headers to outgoing mail.
Good idea; there's already a variety of m-X Add <mumble> Field commands.
Perhaps there should be a generic m-X Add Header field command, which
would come in two versions.  In editing a message in your file,
it would add any kind of header, and in editing a draft to be
sent, it should limit you to types of headers which can be
sent through the mail.

This command could prompt for the header type, with completion.

    This has been happening lots in 5.2 but usually the error is caught
    and I can't send in the backtrace.  But this time, here it is.  Note
    that these errors happen only for dec 20's excluding oz.

    >>Error: Mail error from XX: -Error on hostname lookup

In my machine, (describe (net:parse-host "MIT-CLS"))
  #<UNIX-HOST MIT-CLS 55630227>, an object of flavor FS:UNIX-HOST,
   has instance variable values:

My guess this is not a LispM bug, but a lack of timely updating of the
host table on XX (and whatever other 20s you notice this on).

Subject: I only want one version of my Babyl file on OZ
To: BUG-ZMAIL at MIT-OZ

In System 98.67, CADR 3.8, ZMail 53.18, MIT-Specific 22.2, microcode 309,
ZM MIT, on Lisp Machine Eight:

Insert your description of the circumstances here:

I only want there to be one version of x.gyro.babyl kept on OZ -- the
damn thing is big enough without there being N of it.  So I set "File to
read in at startup" to "x.gyro.babyl.1".  I just went through this with
the Symbolics people, and it works in their system.  I gather all that's
needed is for OPEN to be given the appropriate :IF-EXISTS option?

>>ERROR: File already exists (new file required) for OZ:PS:<X.GYRO>X.GYRO.BABYL.1

Subject: ZMAIL HANGS SELF.  GAVAN CONSIDERS SAME.
To: BUG-ZMAIL at MIT-OZ

In Symbolics 3600 ZMAIL in Release 5.2, Experimental RELATUS 131.26,
FEP 18, on Lisp Machine John Lennon:

I've been trying to write out my babyl buffer for about four hours now, and am
going home.  It inevitably hangs in "File Net Out".  I tried initializing
namespaces and network (at CJL's suggestion), and that resulted in some
incremental improvement (it got through about 80% before hanging).  Anyway, I
really don't want to lose my mail, so I will not boot the machine.  Maybe
ZMAIL will awake and write it out while I'm sleeping.  If any kind soul
wants to look at its state and maybe even help get it written out, please
feel free.  It's on John Lennon until someone boots it.

Sigh.

Subject: Inbox+Buffer lock
To: Bug-Zmail at MIT-OZ

In Symbolics 3600 Zmail in Release 5.2, on Lisp Machine Joe Louis:

What does "Inbox+Buffer lock" in the wholine mean? Zmail goes into
this state periodically, usually when I continue reading past the
last message currently displayed in the summary window. When this happens, 
Zmail goes catatonic for a while. It goes into this sufficiently frequently
that it becomes annoying at times. I assume its some kind of synchronization
wait, but maybe some thought should be given to how to reduce this
bottleneck. Along with the speed of reading in mail files, this seems to be
ZMail's major performance problem.

    ZMail's major performance problem.

You don't mention it, but this must be happening when the mailbox and
inbox are still being input, or have just been input.  The lock
mentioned is indeed a synchornization wait: the Zmail foreground process
needs to parse and display the summary for the next message, and is
obliged to wait for the background process, which is parsing messages
somewhere in the file, to finish the message it is on and relinquish the
lock.  Clearly, they have to avoid interfering with each other.

If all this seems terribly slow, it is probably because parsing of input
messages is slow in general.  Try the following setting:

(setq zwei:*allow-namespace-server-parsing-host* nil)

This will inhibit verifying every host name in every address of every
message, which involves consulting the namespace system each time.  Most
of this work is wasted anyway, because you read and delete most
messages.  When you reply to a message, if the addresses aren't yet
validated, it will be done then, just for the message being replied to.
The default on this variable has been changed to nil in release 6.

(1) Why do you need these??  (2) In what circumstances isn't
standard-output and standard-input the right thing?  (3) Why are you
using VARIABLE-BOUNDP and then SYMEVAL.  That is, (BOUNDP 'X) is to
(SYMEVAL 'X) as (VARIABLE-BOUNDP 'X) is to X.  (4) Why is returning NIL
the right thing.  Shouldn't it err, or is your application code going
to check for that?  (5) [In Release 6] What you have won't work anyway.
These variables are bound per process in, for Zmacs, (:method
zwei:top-level-editor :combined :edit) so you already have to be in the
appropriate process anyway, in which case you can just make free
references.

Subject: Sending Mail From Lisp Machines

I was sending a message to standford with only one host in the to header and
no cc header and I got a too many hosts error from XX and EE.  the only
Tops-20 that handles mail properly (using rel 5.2 prime) is OZ.  Why is this?
Are these 20s broken or is the lisp machine giving them the wrong information?

This is a serious problem and should be attended to.  Hornig suggested
removing XX, EE, and SPEECH from the list of mail-forwarders in the MIT
namespace.  If this is indeed a top-20 bug and not a lisp machine bug, this
could be an interim solution.  However, this error is a recent phenomena that
began with rel 5.2.  That may mean that the lisp machine is at fault, or it is
now using some documented feature which has not been implemented on those 20s.

What's the verdict?

Why doesn't this know to check if the host is up, before going off and losing?
If it is going to be stupid and blow out instead of finding a host that is up,
why is there no proceed handler which offers to try another host?

It had already given up on all of the mailers it knew about and was

happen to know that it's in Syracuse NY.  Couldn't ZMAIL just assume random
timezones to be the local timezone (maybe with some marking to warn the
unsuspecting reader), or could this cause other problems I'm not aware of?

I was trying to read in a Unix file that contain a bunch of messages,
which I wanted to merge into by existing Babyl files.  I Clicked on [Get
Inbox] which offered to [Read file] and [Examine File].  The following
backtrace comes from using [Read file] but a similar response occured
when using [Examine file].

I just aborted the error, and it appears the file was correctly read in!

This is the response you sent to an earlier report of this problem.
Frankly, I don't understand your response.

	I have had this problem twice while ``Examine File''ing a mail file.
	This particular set of problems was started by examining
	aspen:>RZ>Mail.text, I have had similar problems with Unix mailboxes.
	I'd localize this for you better if our syshost was up.
    
    This backtrace shows you were trying to do a [Get inbox] on the
    file you were examining!  First of all, that's completely counter
    to the concept of Examining a file, i.e. it's not a READ-ONLY
    operation.  Secondly, the file you were examining was itself your
    inbox file.  You should select your mbox file (unix) or your BABYL
    file (Lispm, ITS, TOPS-20, or unix), and give the [Get inbox]
    command on that buffer.  (This is done automatically for you if
    you just type G or [Get inbox] at a completely fresh Zmail).
    
    Why don't you tell us what you were trying to do, and we'll tell
    you how to do it?

What are you trying to do?  If you want it to save just as soon as input
is complete, ALWAYS, then just set it to do background saves (the

Ah, now I see what the problem is, and it's still true in the
development system.  (First, the S has to be discarded, in the current
state of things, to prevent horrible things from happening if it were to
try to do a save before input is finished.  There are windows in the
foreground-background interaction that are not well understood.)  

But you can have the (b) behavior, as most people do.  Do either or both
of the following:

  (setq zwei:*hang-background-process-when-deexposed* nil)

in your init file will do it; and you can toggle this variable with the
Zmail command m-X Enable Background Process When Deexposed.  With the
variable set to nil, the mailbox and inbox will be read in the
background at reduced priority, even when Zmail is deexposed.

What amazes me is that the default setting of that variable is still T.
This dates from before reduced priority and other improvements were
installed in Zmail.  I guess it wasn't noticed because almost everybody
has by now setq'd that variable in their init files.  Sorry you had to
find this out the hard way.

Fixed in Release 6.

	Um, I haven't done this yet, but I'm wondering if there is a way
to do this so that I don't get clobbered.  I have a particular INBOX
which primarily gets archives.  I want to undigestify each messge
if possible "regardless" when it comes in.  I can right the required 
filters, etc. myself; but I am concerned about the "speed" if for example.
I have 10 messages in my old mail file, and 5 new digests.
If I am reading in the digest in sequential order, I would think that
digets #1 gets spewed into (say) messages 11-15; causing my last 4 messages
to get renumbered.  If there are a lot of new digests, this might be a
screw, in that it would seem to take forever.

Also, what is the "preferred or advertised" means for letting ZMAIL
convert my RMAIL file into a BABYL file format.  My biggest gripe with
ZMAIL right now is the lack of functionality provided by the I command
in Babyl.  For example, when MC was flakey, I managed to read in my 
BABYL and inbox, but couldn't right them out.  I had to kludge to
save them on EE when EE was up, and it took much more effort for
me to convince ZMail to write the file out to MC when MC is back.

I can't even resist a silly idea for USER-defined filters; a special form
like (WITHOUT-UPDATING-ZMAIL-DISPLAY...

In System 98.80, CADR 3.10, ZMail 53.19, MIT-Specific 22.5,
microcode 309, ZM MIT d, on Arthur Dent:

A couple of gratitious little bugs, read closely.

I typed (zmail "oz:mc:sipb;hdt rmail") from a lisp listener and walked away.
When I came back a long time later, the who line only showed 23% of the file read in,
and no lights indicating that more files were being read in.  The counter said 
53/??? messages read in.  Sure enough 10j jumped ok.   999J didn't do ANYTHING, not even
beep or typein-line something.   I then typed G or something, and I got stuck in
file lock.   I did control-meta-break to enter the debugger.  Perhaps a kind of
"emergency break" on the Other or somewhere on the zmail Menu would be helpful.
* This emergency break could also provide for certain options like:
   1)  Run the equivlent of salvage-zmail
   2) let you specify differnt file names in a better way
   3) say to reset the current zmail user

Then, certain relevent debugging info could be perserved, like which characters I 
actually typed.

The zmail Menu concept is also a problem when your mouse gets wedged.  Since the 
ZMail menu is relatively fixed, perhaps just some ZMail command that did something 
simple like say "pretend the mouse is moved over to the next menu choice to
the left/up/down/right/abort" via a keystroke.
not a good idea.

Anyway, I never typed anything wierd at the machine; yet it still has read
only 23% or my rmail file.

In System 98.80, CADR 3.10, ZMail 53.19, MIT-Specific 22.5,
microcode 309, ZM MIT d, on Arthur Dent:


I did (chaos:reset)
      (zwei:reset-zmail-user)
      (zmail)

Sometime after my last message, I believe I did a system-control-M

In zmail I did get new mail (clicked) and specified mc:sipb;hdt rmail.

Went into Lock state again, then process KBD SYS got an error.   Here it is.

Message-ID: <ZZZ.RLK.12079406577.BABYL@MIT-OZ>

Subject: feature-zmail doesn't exist, so...

It's impossible to do anything on zmail without a mouse -- i. e. it's
weaker than babyl, even.

There's no i command, to read in a new file, and there's no 1g to get
mail from any mail file.  These are useful commands, particularly in
conjunction with multiple babyl files.

Also the business of saving mail in things like
-temporary-file-.number causes problems often, like when things don't
save well, such as blown quotas and the like.

Also when the buffer gets totally full (whostate is buffer full) it
tends to do very nasty things, like nothing at all.  And often the
mouse won't do anything except move around, and even the system key
doesn't work.  Which generally means that in this state I can't send a
bug report that means anything.  All these seem to occur violently in
whatever zmail runs in 98.80.  Don't say use 99; the EE machines can't
because they don't have enough control memory, so we have to use 98.

The buffer full tends to occur when I have 2 or 3 huge mail files
loaded at once.  This occurs because I crash them together to form a
giant mail file that can be disposed of gracefully in a useful
fashion.

    In Symbolics 3600 ZMAIL in System 242.356, Hardcopy 20.10, FEP 22, on Lisp Machine Sid Vicious:

    How about the babyl "\" command?
I'm an old Hermes hacker, never learned Babyl.  What does the "\"
command do?

    How about completion in the "l" command (a la Babyl).  By the way, if
    you type l and then <help>, you get useless mouse documentation.

These two things go together.  I presume what you would like would be
being able to type a few chars and <complete> to recognize an existing
keyword, or type a new one and have it accepted.  That would be good,
and if that were done, then <help> could easily show a list of the
recognizable possibilities, as in other type-one-of-a-set contexts.

Most of this is already there in another form, of course, in the mouse
interface.  Just click right on Keywords, and you get a menu of existing
keywords, plus the "New" choice.  But the suggestion is good.

We will be revamping the interface for Zmail and other user systems for
Release 7 to have a uniform Command Processor input style.  This type of
improvement will be incorporated in that, if not in earlier tweaks.

You have a problem with your mailer; I got your reply twice, but with
slightly different headers (so that Delete Duplicate Messages wouldn't
realise it).

However, the message-id's are identical.  Which leads me to a suggestion
(hence my sending this to bug-zmail):  Delete Duplicate Messages should
examine message-id's and use that.  Now I'm asking for things, how about
giving it three modes: examine message-id only (fast), textual
examination only (current behavior), and both?

I rebooted Ford.  That didn't look too terribly weird.  When the machine
runs out of vm about all you can really do is boot it.

We warmbooted Ford and left it for you to look at.  Jsol sent you a
