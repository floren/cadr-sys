This error is really obnoxious.  Why can't the lispm be smart enough to figure
whether a random tops20 can handle multiple recipients in the to field (or
whatever the problem really is)?  Why can't we get this patch right away?
This is really a major pain.

If XX can't support being a mail gateway, then edit its host object to
remove its STORE-AND-FORWARD-MAIL service.

Subject: Sending Mail From Lisp Machines
To: bug-mail@MIT-OZ, bug-zmail@MIT-OZ

I was sending a message to standford with only one host in the to header and
no cc header and I got a too many hosts error from XX and EE.  the only
Tops-20 that handles mail properly (using rel 5.2 prime) is OZ.  Why is this?
Are these 20s broken or is the lisp machine giving them the wrong information?

This is a serious problem and should be attended to.  Hornig suggested
removing XX, EE, and SPEECH from the list of mail-forwarders in the MIT
namespace.  If this is indeed a top-20 bug and not a lisp machine bug, this
could be an interim solution.  However, this error is a recent phenomena that
began with rel 5.2.  That may mean that the lisp machine is at fault, or it is
now using some documented feature which has not been implemented on those 20s.

What's the verdict?

Why doesn't this know to check if the host is up, before going off and losing?
If it is going to be stupid and blow out instead of finding a host that is up,
why is there no proceed handler which offers to try another host?

    In Symbolics 3600 System 242.356, Hardcopy 20.10,
    Experimental RELATUS 131.96, FEP 22, on Lisp Machine Jim Morrison:

    Why doesn't this know to check if the host is up, before going off and losing?
    If it is going to be stupid and blow out instead of finding a host that is up,
    why is there no proceed handler which offers to try another host?

    >>Error: ML (at Chaos address 3114) did not respond to a MAIL request.
    While in the function CHAOS:CHECK-CONNECTION-STATE  CHAOS:WAIT-FOR-CONNECT  CHAOS:CONNECT

It had already given up on all of the mailers it knew about and was
trying to deliver the mail directly to the destination.  In the next
release, you will be warned when this happens and you will also get
useful proceed option.

Understandable, the lispm doesn't grok the timezone (LCL).  I suppose it means
LoCaL time.  Of course, who knows where suvm.BITNET is, anyway?  Well, I
happen to know that it's in Syracuse NY.  Couldn't ZMAIL just assume random
timezones to be the local timezone (maybe with some marking to warn the
unsuspecting reader), or could this cause other problems I'm not aware of?

I was trying to read in a Unix file that contain a bunch of messages,
which I wanted to merge into by existing Babyl files.  I Clicked on [Get
Inbox] which offered to [Read file] and [Examine File].  The following
backtrace comes from using [Read file] but a similar response occured
when using [Examine file].

I just aborted the error, and it appears the file was correctly read in!

This is the response you sent to an earlier report of this problem.
Frankly, I don't understand your response.

	In Symbolics 3600 Release 5.2, FEP 18, on Lisp Machine Aspen:
    
	I have had this problem twice while ``Examine File''ing a mail file.
	This particular set of problems was started by examining
	aspen:>RZ>Mail.text, I have had similar problems with Unix mailboxes.
	I'd localize this for you better if our syshost was up.
    
    This backtrace shows you were trying to do a [Get inbox] on the
    file you were examining!  First of all, that's completely counter
    to the concept of Examining a file, i.e. it's not a READ-ONLY
    operation.  Secondly, the file you were examining was itself your
    inbox file.  You should select your mbox file (unix) or your BABYL
    file (Lispm, ITS, TOPS-20, or unix), and give the [Get inbox]
    command on that buffer.  (This is done automatically for you if
    you just type G or [Get inbox] at a completely fresh Zmail).
    
    Why don't you tell us what you were trying to do, and we'll tell
    you how to do it?

What are you trying to do?  If you want it to save just as soon as input

I definitely don't want it to always save when input is complete, but I

it discards an "S" command if input is in progress.  I would even be

The net result is that the mailer locks down the console for the time it
takes to read my mail file when it should not have to.  Instead it could
(a) save the "S" command until it can be processed or (b) read the mail
file in at low priority even when de-selected or both.

    takes to read my mail file when it should not have to.  Instead it could
    (a) save the "S" command until it can be processed or (b) read the mail
    file in at low priority even when de-selected or both.

Ah, now I see what the problem is, and it's still true in the
development system.  (First, the S has to be discarded, in the current
state of things, to prevent horrible things from happening if it were to
try to do a save before input is finished.  There are windows in the
foreground-background interaction that are not well understood.)  

But you can have the (b) behavior, as most people do.  Do either or both
of the following:

  (setq zwei:*hang-background-process-when-deexposed* nil)

in your init file will do it; and you can toggle this variable with the
Zmail command m-X Enable Background Process When Deexposed.  With the
variable set to nil, the mailbox and inbox will be read in the
background at reduced priority, even when Zmail is deexposed.

What amazes me is that the default setting of that variable is still T.
This dates from before reduced priority and other improvements were
installed in Zmail.  I guess it wasn't noticed because almost everybody
has by now setq'd that variable in their init files.  Sorry you had to
find this out the hard way.

Fixed in Release 6.

I occaisionally move message to other mail files with the mouse and

in the echo area, when it has finished moving the message.  It sure
would be nicer if it told you which message got moved.  E.g.,

Instead of 

Moved message to  file vx:/usr/...

	Um, I haven't done this yet, but I'm wondering if there is a way
to do this so that I don't get clobbered.  I have a particular INBOX
which primarily gets archives.  I want to undigestify each messge
if possible "regardless" when it comes in.  I can right the required 
filters, etc. myself; but I am concerned about the "speed" if for example.
I have 10 messages in my old mail file, and 5 new digests.
If I am reading in the digest in sequential order, I would think that
digets #1 gets spewed into (say) messages 11-15; causing my last 4 messages
to get renumbered.  If there are a lot of new digests, this might be a
screw, in that it would seem to take forever.

Also, what is the "preferred or advertised" means for letting ZMAIL
convert my RMAIL file into a BABYL file format.  My biggest gripe with
ZMAIL right now is the lack of functionality provided by the I command
in Babyl.  For example, when MC was flakey, I managed to read in my 
BABYL and inbox, but couldn't right them out.  I had to kludge to
save them on EE when EE was up, and it took much more effort for
me to convince ZMail to write the file out to MC when MC is back.

I can't even resist a silly idea for USER-defined filters; a special form
like (WITHOUT-UPDATING-ZMAIL-DISPLAY...

In System 98.80, CADR 3.10, ZMail 53.19, MIT-Specific 22.5,
microcode 309, ZM MIT d, on Arthur Dent:

A couple of gratitious little bugs, read closely.

I typed (zmail "oz:mc:sipb;hdt rmail") from a lisp listener and walked away.
When I came back a long time later, the who line only showed 23% of the file read in,
and no lights indicating that more files were being read in.  The counter said 
53/??? messages read in.  Sure enough 10j jumped ok.   999J didn't do ANYTHING, not even
beep or typein-line something.   I then typed G or something, and I got stuck in
file lock.   I did control-meta-break to enter the debugger.  Perhaps a kind of
"emergency break" on the Other or somewhere on the zmail Menu would be helpful.
* This emergency break could also provide for certain options like:
   1)  Run the equivlent of salvage-zmail
   2) let you specify differnt file names in a better way
   3) say to reset the current zmail user

Then, certain relevent debugging info could be perserved, like which characters I 
actually typed.

The zmail Menu concept is also a problem when your mouse gets wedged.  Since the 
ZMail menu is relatively fixed, perhaps just some ZMail command that did something 
simple like say "pretend the mouse is moved over to the next menu choice to
the left/up/down/right/abort" via a keystroke.
not a good idea.

Anyway, I never typed anything wierd at the machine; yet it still has read
only 23% or my rmail file.

Subject: feature-zmail doesn't exist, so...

It's impossible to do anything on zmail without a mouse -- i. e. it's
weaker than babyl, even.

There's no i command, to read in a new file, and there's no 1g to get
mail from any mail file.  These are useful commands, particularly in
conjunction with multiple babyl files.

Also the business of saving mail in things like
-temporary-file-.number causes problems often, like when things don't
save well, such as blown quotas and the like.

Also when the buffer gets totally full (whostate is buffer full) it
tends to do very nasty things, like nothing at all.  And often the
mouse won't do anything except move around, and even the system key
doesn't work.  Which generally means that in this state I can't send a
bug report that means anything.  All these seem to occur violently in
whatever zmail runs in 98.80.  Don't say use 99; the EE machines can't
because they don't have enough control memory, so we have to use 98.

The buffer full tends to occur when I have 2 or 3 huge mail files
loaded at once.  This occurs because I crash them together to form a
giant mail file that can be disposed of gracefully in a useful
fashion.

    How about the babyl "\" command?
I'm an old Hermes hacker, never learned Babyl.  What does the "\"
command do?

    How about completion in the "l" command (a la Babyl).  By the way, if
    you type l and then <help>, you get useless mouse documentation.

These two things go together.  I presume what you would like would be
being able to type a few chars and <complete> to recognize an existing
keyword, or type a new one and have it accepted.  That would be good,
and if that were done, then <help> could easily show a list of the
recognizable possibilities, as in other type-one-of-a-set contexts.

Most of this is already there in another form, of course, in the mouse
interface.  Just click right on Keywords, and you get a menu of existing
keywords, plus the "New" choice.  But the suggestion is good.

We will be revamping the interface for Zmail and other user systems for
Release 7 to have a uniform Command Processor input style.  This type of
improvement will be incorporated in that, if not in earlier tweaks.

You have a problem with your mailer; I got your reply twice, but with
slightly different headers (so that Delete Duplicate Messages wouldn't
realise it).

However, the message-id's are identical.  Which leads me to a suggestion
(hence my sending this to bug-zmail):  Delete Duplicate Messages should
examine message-id's and use that.  Now I'm asking for things, how about
giving it three modes: examine message-id only (fast), textual
examination only (current behavior), and both?

ps: to help you trace your problem, here are the headers of the two messages:

It seems that my filter named lossage (which is supposed to filter all
bandykin mail) doesn't do the right thing when mail is sent to bandykin
(or one of its many aliases) from a uucp site that has a ! in it.

For that matter, my filters to grab prog-d mail and info-cpm mail lose
under similar circumstances.  Well, actually my info-cpm filter loses
under all circumstances.

In Brand S (at least) you can use  and  to get subset matching.  You

The initial default for [Move(L)] or O is taken from the profile.  It's

    Uh-uh.  I have no zmail init.

If there is no setting of *DEFAULT-MOVE-MAIL-FILE-NAME*, the initial
default move destination comes from

  (FS:MERGE-PATHNAMES USER-ID (SEND (FS:USER-HOMEDIR) ':NEW-CANONICAL-TYPE ':XMAIL))

which puts the pathname on your login host, not your mail host.

The way to override the default, of course, is to set the
*DEFAULT-MOVE-MAIL-FILE-NAME* to the pathname of your choice in your
Lispm-init, or set it up via the Zmail profile in a Zmail-init.

    Yes, a bad loss, as more machines are being installed outside of North
    America.  This is very high on my queue to fix.

This particular problem can be fixed (I think.. I know that it parses this
case correctly and that none of the test cases fail.  I can't 100% guarantee
that it does not break some other legal date) by adding the following
patterns to the time parser just after the other time-zone clauses (search
for "(christmas)" and put it just before that clause) in
SYS:IO1;TIMPAR.LISP.

(defun set-time-zone-from-number (number)
  (if (not (null *abs-time-zone*))
      (barf "Time zone specified twice."))
  (setq *abs-time-zone* (// number 100.)))

(defpattern main (- (fixp 4)) main
	    (time-zone)
  (set-time-zone-from-number (- (car time-zone))))

(defpattern main (+ (fixp 4)) main
	    (time-zone)
  (set-time-zone-from-number (car time-zone)))

Doug: I don't think that this should go in the sources yet since e.g., it
doesn't do the right thing for the case of "20 Feb 85 19:42 -0130" which
might be a perfectly good timespec at the Upper Slobovodia Computer Center
or some such.

Gumby:  If you want to put this in a private file, you have to patch all of
TIMPAR from the (START-PATTERNS) to the (FINISH-PATTERNS).

	Also, it should perhaps parse as much as it can; this sorts to the
	beginning of the beffer because it has a null date.

    Well, I think the right fix is just to parse any date that a person
    could parse (without guesswork).

Both of these worthwhile goals will require a complete rewrite of the
current time parser.  Someday...

By default, Zmail always send mail to a store-and-forward mail server
at your site for later delivery.  The only store-and-forward mailers at
your local site (AI) are OZ and HTVAX.  MC is part of the MIT site.

You can override Zmail's defaults by setting ZWEI:*MAIL-NETWORK-HOST*.
If you set it to your local hosts's object (in NET:*LOCAL-HOST*) your
machine will always try to send mail directory to its destination.  If
you set it to some other host object, you machine will always use that
host as a mail server.

Known problem, sigh.  There is a window that allows conflicting commands
to start operation when they shouldn't be allowed to, because the
background is still getting and inserting an inbox.  This is high on the
bug list.  Thanks for the report.

In ZMAIL in System 98.80, CADR 3.10, ZMail 53.19, MIT-Specific 22.5,
microcode 309, ZM MIT d, on Arthur Dent:

There are a whole lot of features that are documented in the manual and
existed back in whatever zmail existed in sys97 that are missing.  I've
finally decided to flame.

1)  Hyper-foo commands which are supposed to frob addresses like
control-foo does to characters and meta-foo does with words.

2)  Pruning headers doesn't work.  I have the option turned on in my
profile to automagically do it a la babyl, and C-X Y doesn't prune
headers in yanked mail to boot (very cold, of course).

And if suggestions are solicited (what?  They're not?  Oh well...).

1g in babyl gets new mail from any arbitrary mail file.  None such in
Zmail -- have to read the file in and merge it manually.

I in babyl reads in a new mail file...useful if the mouse is broken.

personal list of keywords to be k1,k2,k3,k4,k5,k6.
The current message I hade previously keyworded "foo"
and did not include this in my keyword list.  From looking
at the stack my guess is that having numbers in keywords
causes this breakage.  But users should be told about this, if
true.  

While I'm here, I might as well inform you all that
when you create a sequence and attempt to get all messages
after a certain date (side issue:  Is there ANY WAY to do the
same thing only BEFORE a certain date?  I can't figure it out.)
and if one types only Month Day at the ext. command window
when prompted, zmail defaults to Month the Dayth, 1986 --
and naturally finds no mail dated since then.

This is the general FUTURE-P problem.  Date parsing generally defaults
to the future in the vanilla case.  We are in the process of changing
various relevant places to default either to the past, or to the current
frame, as appropriate.

I hate to request yet another background zmail process, but it would certainly
be nice if zmail could send mail in the background.  That way I wouldn't have
to wait around for it to connect to random hosts on the internet.  I think
this becomes more relevant with the TCP code, although it is a pain when the
mit hosts are loaded.  If something goes wrong, it can always report back and
ask what should be done.

    I hate to request yet another background zmail process, but it would certainly
    be nice if zmail could send mail in the background.  That way I wouldn't have
    to wait around for it to connect to random hosts on the internet.  I think
    this becomes more relevant with the TCP code, although it is a pain when the
    mit hosts are loaded.  If something goes wrong, it can always report back and
    ask what should be done.

My immediate reaction to this is that I fully sympathize with the
motivation, but feel it would be asking for a lot of trouble.  The
thought of a another whole bunch of zmail operations that need to be
interlocked between processes makes me break out in hives.  The
necessary protocols for dealing with errors (necessitating interrupting
the next thing that the user is on to) would be confusing and
complicated.  

And the user's own operations would be desynchronized from
Zmail, in what is likely to be a highly interactive area.  For example,
you compose a reply to a message and send it, then want to delete
the original message.  Presently, you delete it immediately and go on to
the next message.  But if the message isn't really sent yet, you have to
go on -- without deleting?  Deleting on speculation?  If the send is
unsuccessful, should Zmail undelete the replied-to message and jerk you
back to it?

I'm not saying the idea is without merit, but I doubt it is worth the
effort and risk required.  I think the network sending process should
instead be made as efficient as possible.

    Is this format of header acceptable?  This is what we would like to move to

MMAILR can't handle domains yet, which basically means that no TOPS-20 host
can.  If you want to be able to communicate with the rest of the world, I'd
hold off on these headers just yet.  In fact, I connected to SCRC-TENEX and
SCRC-VIXEN and tried sending mail to Hornig@STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM
and both rejected the host name as invalid.

    (but differently this time).  The whois command seems to have stopped
    taking its default from the sender of the current message.  It always
    defaults now to GUMBY@MC, which, as you can imagine, isn't all that
    interesting.

Gee, it might be, to somebody else.  I just did Whois, with your message
current, and the default was Gumby@MC.  In any case, Whois does indeed
still take its default from the From: header of the current message, in
both 6.0 and the development system.  Or did you really mean the
Sender:?  OK, I changed the development system to use the Sender: if
there is no From:.

Let me know more details if it really seems to fail to pick up the
From: header.

This was due to a bug that has since been fixed in the development
system.  It was triggered by the Date: headers not being identical.  The
duplicate deleter was failing to notice that the messages had equal
Message-ID: headers, which is sufficient by itself.  Thanks for the

Update on the Korean Airlines 007 Disaster

The latest issue of the New York Review has a superbly well-reasoned article by
Murray Sayle on the KE007.  It is well worth the price of the issue.  (Sayle's
writings have been widely circulated in Europe, but not very widely here.)

The most plausible theory as to what happened is that the pilot (or copilot)
simply had the autopilot switched to HDG (heading) at a course of 246 degrees
(the setting for the first leg), past the first intended course correction over
Bethel, rather than switching to the next position, INS (Inertial Navigation
System) -- which would have been the correct course.   There are many details
to be considered along the way to that conclusion, and I do not want to try to
summarize them here.  The last paragraph is worth replicating, however.
  
  But the deepest lesson of all is one we should all draw -- how easily an
  all-too-human mistake, abetted by a conspiracy of circumstances, can defeat
  all of the supposedly infallible safeguards which keep the superpowers 
  balanced on their nuclear knife-edge, and how easily our whole world,
  and not just one wretchedly unlucky airliner could be shot down.

I recommend this article highly.  Peter

Subject: Non-English Programming Languages: Followup

One week ago I posted a request for information about computer languages based 
on native languages other than English.  The response has been tremendous, and
here is a summary of the information provided: 

I have divided the responses into four categories:

  I. Languages based on a ``universal'' language:
   
     APL, which is based on the language of mathematics and uses no native 
     language, was cited by a number of respondents.

 II. Languages based on non-English native languages (as opposed to
     translations of common English-based languages):

     ARABIC: <name not furnished> -- IBM developed an Arabic-based language
             for the Middle Eastern market in the 1960s.  It did not catch on. 

     FRENCH: LSE (Language Scientifique d'Enseignement) -- a teaching language
             used to introduce computer science in French schools

     GERMAN: Telefunken/AEG TR440 assembler language.  The TR440's operating
             system was also in German.

     MALAY: <name not furnished> -- a data management language is currently 
            under development at the National University of Malaysia.

     RUSSIAN: LYaPAS [Ya represents the Cyrillic character that looks 
              like a reflected R] -- a fairly low-level language, described
              as ``a cross between assembler language and APL''

III. Languages which are translations of common English-based languages
     such as FORTRAN, COBOL, and Pascal.  These are produced by simply
     substituting the local equivalents for the language keywords; where
     the language has a strong sentence structure (e.g., COBOL), English
     sentence syntax is generally retained.  [This gives new meaning to
     the term ``dialect''.]

     ARABIC: BASIC (Khawarizmi 1), COBOL

     DANISH: some exist, but precisely which ones was not specified

     FRENCH: BASIC, COBOL, FORTRAN, Pascal (including LM and PIXAL), PL/I
 
     GERMAN: ALGOL, BASIC, COBOL, FORTRAN

     HUNGARIAN: Prolog

     JAPANESE: COBOL, LOGO

     MALAY: BASIC

     PORTUGUESE [Brazil]: ALGOL, LOGO (with Portuguese syntax!)

     RUSSIAN: IBM assembler (the op codes are the same, but the mnemonics
              have been trasnslated into Russian), unspecified "others"

     SPANISH: FORTRAN

     It has also been reported that LISP has been translated into several
     (unspecified) languages.

 IV. The English-based languages are in common use in many non-English speaking
     countries.  These include most of Western Europe and the Middle East, 
     China, and Brazil.

The above information is certainly not exhaustive, and may not be absolutely
accurate; several respondents warned me that it had been many years since
their exposure to the above and that their memories may not have been 100%
correct.  Thank you all for the information and the many interesting anecdotes
you provided.  If anyone should come up with new information on this subject,
I will be delighted to receive it.

Subject: System Software Screws and Programmer Productivity

Many of us, I'm sure, have our little working-style idiosyncrasies.  Little
habits that don't hurt anyone, and in some sense increase our productivity, at
least by making the job more pleasant.  Here's an anecdote about one of mine
and how a humble harmless habit collided head-on with a System Standard.

[Scene 1 : Enter the harmless habit.]
 When I write Fortran (please, I know, but that's a much bigger fight) I use
form-feed characters (Ctrl-L, hereafter <FF>) to delimit subroutines.  My
editor has several commands for dealing with "pages", so such a habit makes it
easy to move around the file, routine by routine.

[Scene 2 : Trouble on the horizon.]
 I write programs on a large, government-funded system with two brands of
supercomputers (Cray and CDC) and also several smaller systems (TOPS-10, VMS).
Such files with <FF> in them compiled fine on the CDC machine, on the DEC
machines, on everything except the Cray.  (I should point out that this
compiler is maintained by the system folks at this place, and implements their
own brand of Fortran, it is not the as-sold-by-Cray compiler.)  On the Cray, I
get a error message saying "Illegal character in statement number field."  No
problem, I thought, I'll ask them to fix the compiler so it ignores <FF>.
Nobody will mind, I thought, because this is an upward compatible change.  I
sent the folks a message explaining the whole thing.  Note that I did NOT ask
that anyone drop what they were doing and fix this immediately; simply that
they consider this change for the next scheduled release of the compiler.

[Scene 3 : Kaboom!]
	  Dear Lowly User,  (paraphrased)
	  Your proposed change would violate Fortran Standard XXX
	 where it says "....", and besides, if you want pretty
	 looking listings with each routine starting on a new page,
	 use the following utility....
 Well, I considered pointing out that no working programs would break because
of this change, that all the other compilers on their system already behaved
that way, that I didn't see any effort to alter all the other compilers to
follow Fortran Standard XXX, and that finally I never mentioned listings at
all - I was talking about an editor.  But I didn't.  You can't fight City
Hall, and all that.

[Scene 4 : Apres le Deluge... more rain.]
 Well I made one more stab at the problem.  If, I thought, the compiler thinks
<FF> is illegal in the statement number field, I'll make it a comment.  (For
those of you who have escaped the purgatory of Fortran syntax; it suffers from
"card-image hangover" -- a "c" in column one denotes a comment.)  So in went
my latest efforts with "C<FF>" as a page delimiter.  Back comes the error --
"Illegal character in statement number field."  So I look a the listing, and
what do I see?  "<FF>C" where I had put "C<FF>".  The *#%@& compiler had
INTERCHANGED THE CHARACTERS IN ORDER TO CREATE AN ILLEGAL STATEMENT!

 I give up.

In Symbolics 3600 Zmail in Release 6.0, IP-TCP 29.0, AISite 8.4,
microcode TMC5-MIC 319, on Lisp Machine John Lennon:

I was innocently attempting to reply to a message in ZMAIL when I was
thrown into the cold load with this error.  It was in the middle of the
:set-configuration message, but I couldn't figure out why; it seemed
(from the disassembled code) to be frobbing the list
tv:screen-manager-queue or something if it was non-nil, but when I
looked at that variable it was nil.

I tried to send a bug report but c-m threw me into the same error.  I
could not even abort to top level; the same thing happened.  I tried
defining sys:meter-function-exit to be an alias for #'false and #'true,
but those made zmail loop infinately.

This was all from memory, but I couldn't do anything else.

	Since when is OZ unknown?  Since when is MC unknown?  Since HTVAX got into
	the mail loop, that's when!  I thought HTVAX was taken out of the loop
	so that problems like this wouldn't arise anymore.

	Maybe the problem is that HTVAX can't handle domains?  Anyway, here's
	the forwarded mail.

	In-Reply-To: Message from "Gavan Duffy <GAVAN%OZ.MIT@MIT-HTVAX.ARPA>" of Tue 23 Apr 85 23:13:31-EST

    This message was addressed to GAVAN%OZ.MIT@MIT-HTVAX.ARPA. It has nothing
    to do with whether HTVAX is or is not 'in the mail loop', the message was
    explicitly routed to HTVAX by the sender and the mail system cannot presume
    to change the requested routing.

    In fact, the message would have gotten rejected whether it went thru HT,
    MC, AI, XX or direct thru OZ itself.  It's true that none of these hosts
    handle domains yet, but even if they did, "OZ.MIT" would still be an
    illegal host name.  There is not now, and there will never be, a top level
    MIT domain.  Furthermore at this time there is no MIT subdomain of any
    top-level domain, so this isn't even a valid abbreviation for any real host
    name.

    Judging by the in-reply-to field, your original message had this as your
    address.  As long as you keep using software that's sending out headers
    with all these bogus 'domains' (or perhaps until an MIT domain is actually
    created), people everywhere are going to have problems replying to you.

OK, then, I believe you.  It's a Symbolics bug.  I'll send it to them.  Thanks.
I still don't know how HTVAX got in there.  Chris?

    From: Gavan Duffy <GAVAN at OZ>

    ZMAIL is losing big, apparently.  Here's the bottom line from GZ,
    yanked from below:

      ``As long as you keep using software that's sending out headers
      with all these bogus 'domains' (or perhaps until an MIT domain is actually
      created), people everywhere are going to have problems replying to you.''  

    Who's in charge over there, anyway?

OK, here's the whole story.

The ".MIT"'s are coming from the INTERNET-DOMAIN-NAME property of the
MIT namespace.  If you don't intend to use domains, you should get rid
of this attribute.  When you do, wou will fond that this is not
sufficient, due to a bug.  The patch given below will fix this bug.

It also fixes a few others.

After all of this, you will now get headers like
"GAVAN%MIT-OZ@MIT-HTVAX.ARPA".  This is intentional.  After all, people
outside of MIT couldn't reply to them if they just said GAVAN@OZ.  It is
using HTVAX because it is an Internet store-and-forward mail server in
the same site as the LispM sending the mail.

I hope you can get your mailers to accept domain names soon.

	    From: Gavan Duffy <GAVAN at OZ>

	    Since when is OZ unknown?  Since when is MC unknown?  Since HTVAX got into
	    the mail loop, that's when!  I thought HTVAX was taken out of the loop
	    so that problems like this wouldn't arise anymore.

	    Maybe the problem is that HTVAX can't handle domains?  Anyway, here's
	    the forwarded mail.

	    In-Reply-To: Message from "Gavan Duffy <GAVAN%OZ.MIT@MIT-HTVAX.ARPA>" of Tue 23 Apr 85 23:13:31-EST

	This message was addressed to GAVAN%OZ.MIT@MIT-HTVAX.ARPA. It has nothing
	to do with whether HTVAX is or is not 'in the mail loop', the message was
	explicitly routed to HTVAX by the sender and the mail system cannot presume
	to change the requested routing.

	In fact, the message would have gotten rejected whether it went thru HT,
	MC, AI, XX or direct thru OZ itself.  It's true that none of these hosts
	handle domains yet, but even if they did, "OZ.MIT" would still be an
	illegal host name.  There is not now, and there will never be, a top level
	MIT domain.  Furthermore at this time there is no MIT subdomain of any
	top-level domain, so this isn't even a valid abbreviation for any real host
	name.

	Judging by the in-reply-to field, your original message had this as your
	address.  As long as you keep using software that's sending out headers
	with all these bogus 'domains' (or perhaps until an MIT domain is actually
	created), people everywhere are going to have problems replying to you.

    OK, then, I believe you.  It's a Symbolics bug.  I'll send it to them.  Thanks.
    I still don't know how HTVAX got in there.  Chris?

	ZMAIL is losing big, apparently.  Here's the bottom line from GZ,
	yanked from below:

	  ``As long as you keep using software that's sending out headers
	  with all these bogus 'domains' (or perhaps until an MIT domain is actually
	  created), people everywhere are going to have problems replying to you.''  

	Who's in charge over there, anyway?

    OK, here's the whole story.

    The ".MIT"'s are coming from the INTERNET-DOMAIN-NAME property of the
    MIT namespace.  If you don't intend to use domains, you should get rid
    of this attribute.  When you do, wou will fond that this is not
    sufficient, due to a bug.  The patch given below will fix this bug.

    It also fixes a few others.

Thanks VERY much for the patch.

    After all of this, you will now get headers like
    "GAVAN%MIT-OZ@MIT-HTVAX.ARPA".  This is intentional.  After all, people
    outside of MIT couldn't reply to them if they just said GAVAN@OZ.  It is
    using HTVAX because it is an Internet store-and-forward mail server in
    the same site as the LispM sending the mail.

    I hope you can get your mailers to accept domain names soon.

Me too.  Who's in charge over here, anyway?

        I hope you can get your mailers to accept domain names soon.
    Me too.  Who's in charge over here, anyway?

The situation on this end is that OZ is running the standard TOPS-20 mail
system, which doesn't support domains yet.  Thus this is the situation at
just about every TOPS-20 in the world.  Probably OZ is not going to support
domains until there is an MIT subdomain and an MIT domain name server, because
we need to be able to talk to domain servers over the chaosnet.  Right now
the few domain servers that exist all talk UDP only (not even TCP!) and
are highly limited and unreliable to boot.

Btw, (bug-zmail people or whoever), connecting to the domain server at
stony-brook and sending any CNAME request returns an authoritative name
error.  That's a bug.

In Symbolics 3600 Release 6.0, IP-TCP 29.0, AISite 8.6,
microcode TMC5-MIC 319, FEP 18, on Lisp Machine Apiary-4:

Why does ZMAIL give me a "The file ~A is owned by ~A.  Save it anyway? "
message when I try to save a mail buffer out using the 'S' key.  It is going out to the
same file it came in from, and I have already logged in (when it was read in)
as that user (which it got from my namespace object).  Just because that is
different than my LISPM username, etc. shouldn't cause me to be queried, at least
not as a default. 

Is there a way to turn this off?  <<Sources not present; disassembly not helpful.>>

A while back, DCP said that ZMAIL sources were to be withheld only for sites
with very limited disk space.  This is clearly not MIT.  He said the ZMAIL
sources should be propagated to MIT pronto.  They're still not here.  Can we
get them soon, please?

I can't look at the file because of its protection, but would guess that
it's owner is LE.GRP.  If you delete the OWNER attribute in the options
section at the head of the babyl file you shouldn't be asked the question.

This is in the BABYL documentation.

went into a "Mail Sequence Lock" for a few moments (there was other

Re:   XMail files in ZBabyl

ZBabyl does not deal well with XMail files.  It says it is appending
to some file other than that listed in the options, and then it
doesn't actually append it anywhere.  I assume this is because most
ZBabyl users use it under ITS...

Here are some excerpts from a photo:

Appending to XMail file PS:<EMACS165>BABYL.EXE.4

Appending to XMail file PS:<MAIL.QUEUE>^V[--QUEUED-MAIL--^V].NEW-132157165463-DOUG-BABYL.1

And I have the following in the header of my Babyl file:

XMail: PS:<DOUG.SYS>CC.TXT.1
XMail Append

(If I edit my Babyl file and change the second line to "Xmail Append: 1"
then Babyl changes it back to this the next time it writes the file.)

In Symbolics 3600 Release 6.0, IP-TCP 29.0, AISite 9.1,
microcode TMC5-MIC 319, FEP 17, on Lisp Machine Bing Crosby:
Warm booted from: ZMACS-WINDOWS.

Awhile back I edited my profile and typed "Randy Parker <parker@oz>" to the choose
variables window in Edit profile for the value of *default-cc-list*.  ZMAIL inserted
the following form in my zmail init file:

(LOGIN-SETQ zwei:*DEFAULT-CC-LIST* '((:PERSONAL-NAME "Randy Parker"
                                                :NAME
                                                "PARKER"
                                                :HOST
                                                (:OBJECT "OZ"))))

When I check *default-cc-list*, it reads as follows:
((:PERSONAL-NAME "Randy Parker" :NAME "PARKER" :HOST (:OBJECT #<TOPS20-HOST OZ 1400364>)))

All this is fine (and has been since that time), but recently, after selecting other
options in the profile variable windows, clicking on EDIT, and then evaling the profile
buffer (this has been repeated several times), any attempt to Reply or Mail generates
this error.  

Of course, *default-cc-list* gives this:
((:PERSONAL-NAME "Randy Parker" :NAME "PARKER" :HOST (:OBJECT "OZ")))

It is clear which is right and how to get the host object, but both are being
generated by the system. I haven't had a chance to look at ZWEI:STRING-FROM-HEADER.

The bug is clearly in the hacked-up version of ZWEI:STRING-FROM-HEADER
that you are using.  I infer that it has been altered to attempt to deal
better with the new state of host namespaces.  It probably assumes that
the :HOST in the parsed header is a Host object; likely it needs to
allow for the string case, and parse it into a host object.

The version of ZWEI:STRING-FROM-HEADER was supplied to us from Hornig to
fix interaction problems with mailers here at MIT. It's too hairy for
me to figure out:

;;; -*- Mode: LISP; Syntax: Zetalisp; Package: ZWEI; Base: 10; Patch-file: T -*-

	    From: Randy Parker <PARKER@OZ>
	    In Symbolics 3600 Release 6.0, IP-TCP 29.0, AISite 9.1,
	    microcode TMC5-MIC 319, FEP 17, on Lisp Machine Bing Crosby:
	    Warm booted from: ZMACS-WINDOWS.

	    Awhile back I edited my profile and typed "Randy Parker <parker@oz>" to the choose
	    variables window in Edit profile for the value of *default-cc-list*.  ZMAIL inserted
	    the following form in my zmail init file:

	    (LOGIN-SETQ zwei:*DEFAULT-CC-LIST* '((:PERSONAL-NAME "Randy Parker"
							    :NAME
							    "PARKER"
							    :HOST
							    (:OBJECT "OZ"))))

	    When I check *default-cc-list*, it reads as follows:
	    ((:PERSONAL-NAME "Randy Parker" :NAME "PARKER" :HOST (:OBJECT #<TOPS20-HOST OZ 1400364>)))

	    All this is fine (and has been since that time), but recently, after selecting other
	    options in the profile variable windows, clicking on EDIT, and then evaling the profile
	    buffer (this has been repeated several times), any attempt to Reply or Mail generates
	    this error.  

	    Of course, *default-cc-list* gives this:
	    ((:PERSONAL-NAME "Randy Parker" :NAME "PARKER" :HOST (:OBJECT "OZ")))

	    It is clear which is right and how to get the host object, but both are being
	    generated by the system. I haven't had a chance to look at ZWEI:STRING-FROM-HEADER.



	    >>Error: The array, "OZ", is not a valid function except when
		     given a valid subscript as its argument.
	    While in the function "OZ"  ZWEI:STRING-FROM-HEADER  ZWEI:PRINT-ADDRESS-HEADER

	The bug is clearly in the hacked-up version of ZWEI:STRING-FROM-HEADER
	that you are using.  I infer that it has been altered to attempt to deal
	better with the new state of host namespaces.  It probably assumes that
	the :HOST in the parsed header is a Host object; likely it needs to
	allow for the string case, and parse it into a host object.

Right. See below.

    The version of ZWEI:STRING-FROM-HEADER was supplied to us from Hornig to
    fix interaction problems with mailers here at MIT. It's too hairy for
    me to figure out:

It switches the screen back to the proper window configuration,

Good grief.  There are a number of such transitions in various calendar
configurations that exhibit this behavior.  There is some misalignment
in the window configurations that has to be fixed.  Meanwhile, I
discovered that the clicking-on-the-mode-line-window trick doesn't fix
the configuration permanently.  To do that, you need to configure to
Both, then configure back to Month or whatever was desired.

	    In Symbolics 3600 Release 6.0, IP-TCP 29.0, AISite 9.1,
	    microcode TMC5-MIC 319, FEP 17, on Lisp Machine Bing Crosby:
	    Warm booted from: ZMACS-WINDOWS.

	    Awhile back I edited my profile and typed "Randy Parker <parker@oz>" to the choose
	    variables window in Edit profile for the value of *default-cc-list*.  ZMAIL inserted
	    the following form in my zmail init file:

	    (LOGIN-SETQ zwei:*DEFAULT-CC-LIST* '((:PERSONAL-NAME "Randy Parker"
							    :NAME
							    "PARKER"
							    :HOST
							    (:OBJECT "OZ"))))

The problem is here!  "OZ" isn't a host object, it's a string.  ZMail
shouldn't be putting it there.

	    When I check *default-cc-list*, it reads as follows:
	    ((:PERSONAL-NAME "Randy Parker" :NAME "PARKER" :HOST (:OBJECT #<TOPS20-HOST OZ 1400364>)))

	    All this is fine (and has been since that time), but recently, after selecting other
	    options in the profile variable windows, clicking on EDIT, and then evaling the profile
	    buffer (this has been repeated several times), any attempt to Reply or Mail generates
	    this error.  

	    Of course, *default-cc-list* gives this:
	    ((:PERSONAL-NAME "Randy Parker" :NAME "PARKER" :HOST (:OBJECT "OZ")))

	    It is clear which is right and how to get the host object, but both are being
	    generated by the system. I haven't had a chance to look at ZWEI:STRING-FROM-HEADER.



	    >>Error: The array, "OZ", is not a valid function except when
		     given a valid subscript as its argument.
	    While in the function "OZ"  ZWEI:STRING-FROM-HEADER  ZWEI:PRINT-ADDRESS-HEADER

	    "OZ":
	       Arg 0: :DEFAULT-MAIL-NAMING-CONVENTION

	    ZWEI:STRING-FROM-HEADER:  (P.C. =223)  (from 1AISITE: AISITE; NETWORK0)   What's this?!?
	       Arg 0 (HEADER): (:PERSONAL-NAME "Randy Parker" :NAME "PARKER" :HOST (:OBJECT "OZ"))
	       Arg 1 (FORMAT): NIL
	       Arg 2 (NAMING-CONVENTION): :DEFAULT

	The bug is clearly in the hacked-up version of ZWEI:STRING-FROM-HEADER
	that you are using.  I infer that it has been altered to attempt to deal
	better with the new state of host namespaces.  It probably assumes that
	the :HOST in the parsed header is a Host object; likely it needs to
	allow for the string case, and parse it into a host object.

There is no "string case".  If you say :OBJECT, there should be an
object.  If you want an arbitrary string, use :SINGLE.

microcode TMC5-MIC 319, FEP 18, on Lisp Machine Sancho Panza:

Why must ZMAIL be so slow with 30-60 messages, when BABYL on MC is
fast with 100-150 messages, and acceptable with over 200?  Even with
very few messages in the babyl file, ZMAIL is so slow that I routinely
read my mail with Show File mail.text, and send mail by connecting
to MC and using babyl.  This is not good service by, or advertising for,
Symbolics.

Certainly the manual informs me that ZMAIL provides me with a wide range
of sophisticated services (which I generally don't use).  Why do I have
to pay for them, and pay heavily, judging from the time it takes?
Elementary software engineering involves designing the architecture of
the system so that simple, often-done actions, like reading one's babyl
and mail files, or sending a message, can be done quickly, while less
frequent things may take longer.

There may appear to be higher priority jobs than rewriting ZMAIL, but
mail handling is an important and frequent part of many people's lives,

It's pretty hard to answer this kind of blanket indictment, containing
general assertions about poor performance with no specifics, numbers, or
points of comparison.  So I'll make an equally broad statement: rest
assured that we are quite conscious of the performance deficiencies of
Zmail, as we are its most intensive users.  Considerable effort is going
into improvements in performance and interface.  But there are dozens of
other projects claiming attention, as well, so there are limits.  You
can expect improvements in future major and minor releases.  Thanks for
your concern.

Presumably In ZMAIL in Symbolics release something, and everywhere else too:

Message sent from Lisp Machines often have very wide lines and are hard
to read.  I know that reasonable mail readers, like BABYL, have commands
which will refill mail messages to make them narrower than 80 columns,
but couldn't the problem be fixed at the source, e.g. by setting the
fill column in send buffers small, or by displaying a warning message,
or by making the window in which the message is composed narrow, or even
by having the editore display a dotted vertical line at the 80th column?
I suspect that many, many users of standard-width displays are annoyed
by wide messages, but consider them to result from the inconsiderateness
of the human sender, instead of a deficiency of the sender's electronic
accomplice, and therefore they don't complain to BUG-ZMAIL.

    (DEFMACRO DEF-MY-MACRO (NAME BVL &BODY (BODY '(...default body...))
					   (DECLS '((DECLARE (SPECIAL *FOO*))))
					   (DOC "a macro"))
      ...)

    I believe that attacking the problem of DECLARE at the level people have been
    attacking it gives up programmer flexibility to no good end (not to mention
    introducing an incompatible change to the language semantics). A change
    like these syntax extensions to DEFMACRO that I've been speaking about would
    make life easy for the macro writer without giving up the macro-writing 
    freedoms I was originally supporting.

I think this is a good suggestion.  Of course we ought to think about it a bit before
adopting it, but I haven't seen any problems of Common Lisp changing too fast lately!

    Date: 16 May 85 14:53 PDT
    From: Masinter.pa@Xerox.ARPA

    The only reason for this issue is because the interpreter has to look
    ahead for SPECIAL declarations. SPECIAL declarations are the only ones
    that have any semantic import. Furthermore, SPECIAL declarations are the
    only ones that are textually retroactive, in that they apply to things
    that appeared BEFORE the declaration rather than after.

This last sentence is not true.  Actually, there are almost no declarations
in Common Lisp that are -not- textually retroactive, because declarations
are placed in the -middle- of the form to which they apply.

    Rather than hacking around the deficiencies of DECLARE, why not change
    it? Put SPECIAL declarations where they belong, next to the variable.
    Leave all the other declarations where they are. Most of these issues
    then become moot, and we can even consider freeing up some of the
    restrictions on declarations; it would seem reasonable to allow
    declarations anywhere in an implicit PROGN to refer to the stuff that
    follows.

I don't think it is only SPECIAL declarations that need to be attached to
variable bindings.  Consider the data-type declarations.

One point I'd like to make in this connection is that making SPECIAL
declarations locally, rather than globally with DEFVAR, is generally not
something we should be encouraging.  It's worth noting that the main use
of local SPECIAL declarations in Maclisp-like languages in the past has
been to simulate what FLET does better.  Now that we have full lexical scoping,
we can probably dispense with local SPECIAL declarations.

Perhaps the SPECIAL declaration should be phased out, so we can say that
DECLARE never has "semantic import", but is only a hint to the compiler
or otherwise an "annotation."  The SPECIAL proclamation would remain, of
course.  If people feel it is necessary, some way to change the SPECIAL
status of a name locally could be retained, but it need not be DECLARE.
It could be a special [multiple puns intentional] version of LET.

This wouldn't change the fact that macro writers need a PARSE-BODY,
since losing an annotation that makes the code run efficiently is almost
as unacceptable as losing an annotation that makes the code run
correctly or one that documents the code.

    From: "Scott E. Fahlman" <Fahlman@CMU-CS-C.ARPA>

    Personally, I like the idea.  I've felt for some time that we ought to
    separate SPECIAL declarations from all the others, even if that means
    that Common Lisp ends up looking a little different from Maclisp.  But
    we should only make this move so late in the game if just about everyone
    else feels likewise.

Agreed.

    Date: 17 May 85 14:55:49 EDT
    From: Charles Hedrick <HEDRICK@RUTGERS.ARPA>

    As an implementor, I would be only too happy to flush the current
    (incomplete) tests for SPECIAL declarations in favor of something
    that is in the lambda list.  The idea of using the pname is
    obviously a bad one, but I don't see any problem with things
    such as
	(foo &special bar)

We haven't bothered to remove support for &SPECIAL from our system yet,
so we could hardly complain if it became a standard instead of an obsolete
holdover from the past!  Again, though, I think there is little real need
for local SPECIAL declarations.

    My theory on this is that it's the reader's, not the writer's, responsibility
    to do this formatting. There is only one sending environment and many reading
    environments. It is not reasonable to suppose that a sender will be able to
    adequately anticipate all possible reading environments, so he's bound to 
    offend someone. It is, on the other hand, reasonable to ask mail readers (and
    editors in general) to have reformatting commands available to help with their
    presentation.

    Consider yourself fortunate, though. I still wish Zmail had the "\" command.
    I tire of manually reformatting skinny 80-column messages that just barely 
    extend past the bottom of my view area so that they are slightly wider and 
    therefore fully visible.

This strikes me as a problem that is basically irresolvable by technical
means.  In other words, I disagree with both of you about how to deal
with this conflict.  I personally favor creating  80-column messages,
by voluntary action, as a community protocol.

The trouble with bashing the user in an attempt to force the sending of
not-too-wide messages is that it won't work, and will just cause
resentment.  There are legitimate reasons to create wide messages on
some occasions.  In any case, it has been shown that attempts to enforce
this kind of protocol by wiring it into the software will fail.

The trouble with expecting the multitude of mail readers to be able to
reformat wide messages as needed is that the approach only works if
every single reader program can do it.  But many can't.  Some operate on
very unpowerful hosts, and some are old and not maintained.  And just
the ones with the least powerful output media (glass teletypes) are the
most likely to be unable to reformat.

True, Zmail exists on a powerful Lisp machine, and should have a \
command.  And some day it might.  But I think the only network-wide
solution to this problem is to persuade the community to format for the
least capable (within reason), that is, limit width to 80 columns.  It's
more readable that way anyway.  And let those who can display a width of
120 reformat for it.

    This strikes me as a problem that is basically irresolvable by technical
    means.  In other words, I disagree with both of you about how to deal
    with this conflict.  I personally favor creating  80-column messages,
    by voluntary action, as a community protocol.

Unlike you, I take a nonconfrontational tack: I agree with BOTH you and
KMP - as a careful reading of my original message would indicate.  (I
guess I'm going against the tide, since most people like to use
electronic mail to argue.)

I think what I meant to suggest was some human engineering which would
make such voluntary action easy to take.  That's what the dotted line
was for.  I definitely didn't want to suggest any restriction, since as
you say, people would complain, and rightfully so.

The Undigestify command in Zmail is very nice.  A small problem with it is that
it tends to leave a leading blank line in the undigestified messages.  Although
this is not a problem for ZMail, subsequent attempts to read the mail file
with Babyl get confused.

That was a mistake that was corrected a while ago, but not quite in time
for Release 6.0; it is fixed in 6.1.  Meanwhile, it can be avoided
either by setting the keyword ordering perdicate to NIL (None), or with
the following patch:

    (DEFUN CHOOSE-KEYWORDS (&OPTIONAL LABEL OLD-KEYWORDS &AUX NEW-KEYWORDS )
      (SEND *KEYWORD-WINDOW* ':SET-LABEL LABEL)

I didn't look at the frames, so this may be obvious to you,
but I just noticed that the Yank Msg command DID do the yank, and then
it bombed.  The report I just sent about moving messages was about that
same message, so obviously there may be some interaction there.

Once a message has something else yanked into it, I should still be able
to treat it as a message (i.e. moving it, replying, etc.), right?

when I hit "S".   Something should permit this, even if it is just
splitting Read/Create File into TWO options, one that checks to make
sure the file exists and reads it, and one that creates it, warning the
user if it does already exist.

    microcode TMC5-MIC 319, FEP 18, on Lisp Machine Apiary-8:


    I didn't look at the frames, so this may be obvious to you,
    but I just noticed that the Yank Msg command DID do the yank, and then
    it bombed.  The report I just sent about moving messages was about that
    same message, so obviously there may be some interaction there.

    Once a message has something else yanked into it, I should still be able
    to treat it as a message (i.e. moving it, replying, etc.), right?

Yes, I suppose, but only if its headers aren't garbaged seems to be the
likely response.

I suspect now that those problems (Yank Msg and Move) arose because the
current message may have gotten garbaged somehow (perhaps blank like or
somesuch at beginning from going into Edit Message mode on it to yank
part to a different message being composed).

It would be nice, though, if Zmail punted making an Included-Msgs:
header (or whatever caused the loss) in the case that the current
message is bogus.

    I can't find anything that lets me do the c-X K "kill buffer"
    equivalent in zmail.  I want to be able to get rid of bad file sequences
    I set up, so that they don't keep getting saved out.

Mouse-right on [save] should give you a menu like zwei's.   Also, my
init file has things like c-X K and c-X c-B, etc if you want that.

I was unable to duplicate this in several tries at various combinations
of the conditions.  And the backtraces don't contain enough information
for further analysis.  I imagine that your "garbaged message" may indeed
be the cause of the problem, but we'll need more to get to the bottom of
things, if it happens again.  If it does, please forward the
(unreformatted) message(s) involved, or at least their headers.  And any
other relevant info you can think of.

Every six months or so I try out Zmail to convince myself that it is
still broken.  Sure enough.  This is a different bug than last time, so
here it is in case you care.  I have no init file, and typed only
``gn''.  Possibly relevant peculiarity: it logged me into SRI-AI twice,
presumably once for the Babyl file and once for the MAIL.TXT, creating
two FTP server jobs and asking for my password twice.

By the way, it also asks for my home directory on SRI-AI, defaulting
correctly.  My user object specifies a username for SRI-AI, and seems
not to have a slot for specifying a home directory.  What do I need to
do?

To: bug-zmail@MIT-MC.ARPA
Message-ID: <850723142225.9.STEVER@APIARY-9>


I had entered Zmail with a normal Select-M.  I clicked left on
Get-Inbox, which retrieved my BABYL file from OZ and loaded my inbox
on top of that (this is what I normally do anyway).

I had replied to a message and forwarded a message before trying to
exit.  I exitted (and got the reported error) by typing Q.  It seemed
to save the file, and it DID readjust the survey display.

... As an aside, is there a way to set up a reply mode so on reply, it
goes TO: the original TO-list and the sender, MINUS me, and CC: the
original CC?  I can't seem to find a way of excluding myself from
replies without excluding others or changing the header in some
undesirable way.

This is a know problem that has eluded our nets so far.  There appears
to be a window in the foreground/background interlocking such that if
you do an operation like Delete to a new message while the inbox is
still being read in the background (for your usual, or default,
mailbox), things sometimes get confused, and ZWEI:*DEFAULT-BUFFER* is
set to the pathname of the inbox, rather than the mailbox.

The trouble shows up later when you Quit or Save, which saves all
buffers, and tries to save the default buffer last (for crash
protection).  But in cases like this, it is trying to save a bogus
mailbox, resulting in this blowup.  In this kind of case, all of the
real mailboxes have already been saved when this blowout happens (as you
observed).  To set things right, select your default mailbox, Suspend,
and compare ZWEI:*DEFAULT-BUFFER* with ZWEI:*SEQUENCE*.  If they are
different, just (SETQ ZWEI:*DEFAULT-BUFFER* ZWEI:*SEQUENCE*).

Some annoying assorted bugs that you probably already know about:

1)  Putting the mouse over "Configure" in the Zmail top-level menu seems
to produce bogusness in the mouse documentation line.  In a freshly
loaded Zmail (default configuration), I moved the mouse over to
"Configure" because of #3 below.  Middle click was "Both".  I clicked
middle and got Month.  I have this set in my zmail-init, but it doc line
should get this so I don't have to remember every change I make in my
init.

2)  zwei:preload-zmail leaves the file state line with the last file
loaded (in my case it shows " filename 97% #") until I actually enter
Zmail.

3)  Changing the summary window fraction in my init only seems to change
things after I both enter Zmail and perform some operation that changes
to another configuration and then goes back.  Is there an easier way to
get this to happen automatically?

    2)  zwei:preload-zmail leaves the file state line with the last file
    loaded (in my case it shows " filename 97% #") until I actually enter
    Zmail.

zwei:preload-zmail has some glitches in its operation, and hasn't been
given enough attention.  We'll try to clean this area up.

    3)  Changing the summary window fraction in my init only seems to change
    things after I both enter Zmail and perform some operation that changes
    to another configuration and then goes back.  Is there an easier way to
    get this to happen automatically?

Numbers 1 and 3 are due to the same thing, which isn't a bug, but can be
surprising: the Zmail user profile is not read and instantiated until
there is a command given for any Zmail operation that depends on a user
option.  (That's almost anything, like Mail, Get Inbox, Configure...)
Therefore, if you change the Both configuration proportion, this doesn't
take effect until you Get Inbox, or whatever.  You don't have to switch
to a different configuration, just do anything to instantiate the
profile.

The reason it was done that way was that installing the profile
generally causes a significant pause, and it was deemed bad and ugly to
have it happen immediately, the first time you select the Zmail frame.
I suppose this could be reconsidered, but I still think it's probably
better (but not necessarily great).

this is a longstanding bug I've reported several times.  This is the Rel
6 report.

If I go into one-window survey mode (e.g. by accidentally clicking the
mouse at the top of the survey pane), then the typout window is
perminently set to be the survey window, no matter what the
configuration of the zmail frame.  Therefore, <help> while sending a
message appears only to hang; the expunge survey forces the survey
window to appear when I am in the message-only configuration, and things
like notifications even appear there!  this is incredibly inconvenient!

You bet.  There have been a number of cases of this kind of confusion in
setting the typeout window when hanging configurations.  All the cases
that I know about are fixed in both the development system and in
Release 6.1.  

A palliative that you can use until 6.1 arrives is this: when the
typeout window is stuck in the survey window, click on Profile (switches
to profile frame), then click on Exit (back to previous top-level
configuration).  This will correct the location of the typeout window to
the message window.

I don't understand this report.  You start out talking about
xx:<gumby>mail.txt, but end up talking about xx:<gumby>gumby.babyl.

At least one of us is confused.  (Obvious, eh?)

Guessing what you mean, in the first sentence, where you say "etc",
was that "click on Find File, specify "XX:<gumby>mail.txt"?  If so,
you've confused the inbox and the buffer.  "XX:<gumby>mail.txt" is
an inbox; it's asking you for a buffer who's inbox you want to read.
Possibly you wanted Middle on Get Inbox.  Perhaps you wanted to
say xx:<gumby>gumby.babyl instead of mail.txt.  Or perhaps you just
wanted the simple thing, Right on Select, Left on Find File, to just
read in and display your XX: babyl file.

You're confused because of my vauge report.  I'l try again.

Nope.  I read xx:<gumby>mail.txt by clicking right on "Get Inbox,"
then left on "Read/Create File," specifying xx:<gumby>gumby.babyl
(whose associated inbox is xx:<gumby>mail.txt). (whew).  No confusion
in my mind, only in my explanation.

IWBNI read and create were separate choices on the Move and Select

Thanks for the response.  Yes, it turns out that at one place in my
Lispm init (which was still loading into lisp) I was turning on :more-p
in tv:selected-window (shame, shame!!).  And yes, it would be nice
if ZWEI panes ignored MORE-P.

    Btw, (bug-zmail people or whoever), connecting to the domain server at

This has never worked, and would be very useful to have in zmail.  Is
there any way to get (zwei:gmsgs) doing the right thing?  The oz gmsgs
command requires a username switch which apparently zmail doesn't
currently provide.  Should be trivial to fix (provided one has access to
the sources...)

Zmail doesn't seem to be able to trim domain info during the
reformatting of headers when the host name is inside <>'s.

For instance, when Zmail reformats headers such as:

To:  Somebody@XX.LCS.MIT.EDU

it produces:

To:  Somebody@XX.LCS        


However, with

To:  John Q Public <Somebody@XX.LCS.MIT.EDU>

it leaves it identical.


<<I guess since domain stuff is such a universal problem
this may be a bit picky.  However, it seems like hosts have been
parsed inside angles before.>>

Warm booted from: Function Suspend.

I was trying to use ZMail to read my mail from a vax, cls, which
I had filled with a few test messages, just to see if I could do it;
hoping, actually, that I could use a nice windowy mail reader once
again!

It seems to work ok, except that it keeps expecting response codes
of 250 from the FTP server it is talking to, and the server is giving
it 200 instead.  Now, I'm not sure if one particular one is mandated
by the protocol, but I do know that all the 200s are positive acks,
so I'd expect ZMail to accept any of them.

RFC 959 claims that 200 means "syntactically correct" while 250 means
"operation completed OK"

This should have gone to bug-lispm, since it's not zmail-specific, but
then again, the problem's most likely at your end since the unix
network software is apparently rife with bugs.

I don't know if this should be a bug report to Babyl or to Zmail, but
here goes.  When Babyl creates a new babyl file with an incoming mail
file associated with it, it chooses the ITS stylistic form:
	DIR; DEV: FOO MAIL
Unfortunately, if I then move this Babyl file to LMFS and then operate
on it, the filename parser appears to be trying to interpret this as
the "DIR; DEV" device, which of course it won't find.  I.e., it seems
that if the Babyl file is not coming off an ITS machine, Zmail doesn't
realize that it should apply ITS file naming conventions to the mail
file name.  Simply choosing the alternative stylistic format:
	DEV: DIR; FOO MAIL
works fine, because then MC: is recognized as the machine, and from
there on the appropriate conventions are applied.

This problem could be fixed either by changing the Babyl preferred way
of listing ITS mail file names or by fixing Zmail so it permits DIR;DEV:
form of file spec as well.

I'd suggest you get Babyl to record DEV:DIR;.  Changing the Lisp machine
pathname parser to hack DIR;DEV: is extremely difficult if not
impossible.

I used the CONTINUE menu option to continue a message I had
successfully sent to many people.  I changed the header so it would be
sent ONLY to the one person I left out the first time I sent the
message.

It seemed to send the message again to ALL of the original recipients.
Is this an undocumented feature?


To recreate:
 (1) Type M, enter a recipient list, <End>, a message, and <End>
 (2) Click left on CONTINUE
 (3) Use ^XO to get to the header window.
 (4) Kill the TO: line and type a new one, containing only one
     recipient.
 (5) Use <end>, <End> to send the message.
 
The message is sent to all of the original recipients.  Ugh.

TMC CM System Software Version : RELEASE-9-FOR-CUSTOMERS (<-- Don't you just hate this advertisement?)

I guess this means that nobody has tried to use the GMSGS servers on the
ITS machines in quite some time.  This is the result of simply turning on
the GMSGS feature in Zmail, and doing a Get Inbox.  I guess I can try
defining a :GMSGS canonical type in a vanilla way and see what happens.

OK, I did that and a files named "ALAN GMSGS" was created on my directory
containing the expected system messages.  Unfortunately ZMail didn't seem
to notice this and just told me I had no new mail.  I guess this feature is
broken in multiple ways.

For the record, I set the string for ZMail to send to the GMSGS server to
be "ALAN * /S/D/Z".  (I don't know what the /Z does exactly, just "/Z" is
the default, and the comments in the GMSGS program say that it is for
ZMAIL's benefit.)

Zmail seems to have trouble parsing ITS headers these days.  I have
determined by experiment that a header like:

ED@AI.AI.MIT.EDU 09/22/86 19:11:26 Re: New Technical Bookstore in Kendall Square

will cause Zmail to be unable to extract the date from the message.  When
edited to read simply:

ED@AI 09/22/86 19:11:26 Re: New Technical Bookstore in Kendall Square

there is no problem.  Looks like someone is making unjustified assumptions
about what the names of ITS machines can look like.

I have just been shafted again by the fact that the "L" command in Zmail
does not offer completion over the set of possible keywords (like the one
in Babyl does).  

I know you guys have resisted this in the past (for reasons that I found
incomprehensible), but perhaps you would consider making it a mode? or
having a separate command that I can re-bind the "L" key to?

Mail messages that arrive from Europe bearing time stamps that include
apparently-standard European time zones such as MEZ or SET fail to parse
correctly in Zmail, leave a blank in the Date field of the message
summary, and cause date sorting operations to put the message in the
wrong place (i.e., ancient).  An example of such a string is
	12 December 1986, 07:07:32 MEZ
Can someone find out what the standard such abbreviations are
(corresponding to EDT, PDT, etc.) and add them?

I can't say for certain.  What does a BBoard look like?  (I've never
used a system that had one, really.)  Can GMSGS be used to read it?  If
it's some form of shared mail file, then you won't have much luck.

    In Symbolics 3640 Zmail in Release 6.1 on Lisp Machine Pigpen:

    TMC CM System Software Version : RELEASE-9-FOR-CUSTOMERS

    Zmail seems to have trouble parsing ITS headers these days.  I have
    determined by experiment that a header like:

    ED@AI.AI.MIT.EDU 09/22/86 19:11:26 Re: New Technical Bookstore in Kendall Square

    will cause Zmail to be unable to extract the date from the message.  When
    edited to read simply:

    ED@AI 09/22/86 19:11:26 Re: New Technical Bookstore in Kendall Square

    there is no problem.  Looks like someone is making unjustified assumptions
    about what the names of ITS machines can look like.

I tried reading one of the files indicated to have been trashed by RWS'
message.  I thought I would see an "OK" file with just some part of it
being all nulls, but instead got the following.  Does this indicate more
damage?  --Pete Sz.

    I tried reading one of the files indicated to have been trashed by RWS'
    message.  I thought I would see an "OK" file with just some part of it
    being all nulls, but instead got the following.  Does this indicate more
    damage?  --Pete Sz.

Looks that way.  If you ran LMFS:FIX-FEP-FILE (I think that's the name),
it has a bug whereby it doesn't really completely fix a file unless it
gets run twice.  This is discussed in one of the Technical Bulletings
for Genera 7.0.  The funciton is fixed in Genera 7.1.

In any event, this isn't a Zmail problem.

[P.S., Sorry about the prior redirection if you saw it.]

Genera 7 does not do the same thing as rel-6 when I try to
read mail.  All my mailboxes point to oz (where my mailbox is).
However, where as rel-6 use to look at my mailbox there (automatically,
or maybe magically), rel-7 does not.  Also, rel-7 refuses to read
oz:<sandy>mail.txt <-- my mailbox.

So, does somebody know how:

  1)  get rel-7 to look at oz for mail like rel-6 used to do.

  2)  get rel-7 to read a oz;<name>mail.txt file.

Thanks, and much appreciated,

    Genera 7 does not do the same thing as rel-6 when I try to
    read mail.  

By "reading mail", do you mean the 1Get New Mail from Inbox0 (1G0) command
or something else?

		All my mailboxes point to oz (where my mailbox is).

What's your home host and mail host according to the namespace?  Does
your Zmail init include a setting of 2zwei:*zmail-startup-file-name*0?  If
so, what is it?

    However, where as rel-6 use to look at my mailbox there (automatically,
    or maybe magically), rel-7 does not.  Also, rel-7 refuses to read
    oz:<sandy>mail.txt <-- my mailbox.

What kind of file is it?  Is it an inbox (i.e., new mail) or a mail file
(i.e., old mail)?  The error below occured because you tried to use it as
an inbox but Zmail believes it's a mail file.  (Its first line indicates
that it's a Babyl file which is not allowed to be an inbox.)

    So, does somebody know how:

      1)  get rel-7 to look at oz for mail like rel-6 used to do.

      2)  get rel-7 to read a oz;<name>mail.txt file.

It works for me.  A more explicit bug report could point me to something
I didn't try, tho.

This bug probably also occurs in Rel. 7, so I am reporting it.
I tried to send mail using ZMAIL.  When I left-clicked on MAIL, the
lispm tried to get my ZMAIL init file.  However, the host on which it
resides was down, so I got an error.  There was *no* option in the error
handler which would let me recover from the error and send mail.  That
is, there was no option which would let me skip loading the init file.
I am able to send this bug report because I logged in as Lisp-Machine,
which caused the lispm to look on a different host for the init file.

You definitely need a Skip Loading Init File option in the error

I noticed that in rel 7.1 when I enter Zmail for the first time and type "g"
it reads in any new mail.text as well as any mail._zmail_text files and then
opens my babyl.text file but gets wedged and never reads it.
I then tried :Initialize Mail (Yes) which promptly read in my babyl file,
appended the new messages to it, wrote out the updated babyl file, and
then emptied the mail buffer and created a new window. Then when I
issued a "g" command to this new window, the same thing happened. How
can I read in my babyl file. HELP!

Reading of the Babyl file wants to take place in Zmail's background
process.  Being a background process, it has a priority of -1.

If you have a heavy compuation running on your machine, the Zmail
background process will never run and, thus, will never read your Babyl
file.  You can try changing the background process' priority but I
suggest not leaving it at other than -1; otherwise, it will interfere
with your interactive use of Zmail.  (There's a 1:Set Process Priority0 CP
command in 7.1, I believe.)

Alternatively, the background process may be broken.  Use Peek to check it out.

(Certain Zmail commands (e.g., N) will explicitly read a message
or two when they're at the end of the buffer.)

I checked with the Peek program and found that the culprit was the
Update-Who-Calls-Data-Base process. It seems that this process has
priority 0 and Zmail background has priority -1 which seems
braindamaged. so I changed Update... to priority -1 and everything
works fine now. Why isn't this in the default world?

Like many variables that appear to be globals, 1zwei:*zmail-background-process*
0is actually an instance variable of the Zmail frame.  You can only play
with it inside methods which bind the specials to the instance
variables.  Fortunately, there's this method whose sole purpose is to
allow you to do this outside Zmail.

  (zwei:funcall-in-zmail-instance zwei:*zmail-window*
    (lambda () 
      (setf (process-priority zwei:*zmail-background-process*) -1)))

Use the first pathname.

There's a bug somewhere in the LispM's handling of TOPS-20 pathnames
that cause the use of the second pathname to produce the problems you
describe.  I've discussed this with someone at MIT before but,
unfortunately, don't remember who that was at present.

The Tenex mail format saved by Zmail isn't compatible with what get MM
accepts.  The problem seems to be in line before the file; MM seems to
require a dash between the time and the EST whereas Zmail doesn't supply
one.  Either Zmail needs to supply this dash or MM must be modified to
accept its header line without it.

For example, Zmail saves messages in a form with the header like this:

[ So if I'm expected to mail bug reports that are to be -answered- to
  Customer-Reports, why did the C-M command automatically offer to send
  this mail to Bug-Zmail@OZ? ]

What kind of a joke is the following?  I like to be able to get new mail
whenever I want, but this is telling me that I have to -wait- for the
background save to -finish- before I can get new mail?  What a screw!  I
suppose my only option now is to turn off saving of my buffer after reading
the inbox?  

How is this better than what it did in Release 6?  As I recall, it would
simply hurry the background saver along before getting my new mail.  Why is
throwing me into the error handler an improvement?  Not only that, but I
found the wording of the first two proceed options I was offered to be
almost completely incomprehensible.  And the other likely sounding proceed
options, like "return to zmail toplevel" or whatever, didn't do anything
useful since I still wasn't allowed to get my new mail!

Oh wonderfull.  This is just dandy.  What fun.

Ok, so I tried changing the thing in my profile called:
"Automatically save buffer after reading inbox".  I tried to set it to be
"No".  So in profile mode I clicked in the User Options menu to highlight
the word "No" on the line labeled "Automatically save buffer after reading
inbox".  The I clicked on "Insert Changes" and a line reading:

  (LOGIN-SETQ *INHIBIT-BACKGROUND-SAVES* T)

was inserted in my zmail init.  (I think that's what changed, its always
hard to tell just what it changes if you aren't looking closely.)  Then I
clicked Middle on Save (Make profile compiled), and it saved, compiled, and
loaded my zmail-init file.  Then I clicked on Exit.

Now back in the main window, I typed "G" to pick up some mail from my
inbox.  Strangely, zmail started saving my buffer in the background anyway.
To see if the bug I previously reported was still present, I typed "G"
again, and yes, the thing I complaind about before happened again.  OK, so
I typed <Resume>, and it finished up the background save, and threw me into
the debugger with the error message below.

That was bug number 1.  

Now I went back into Profile mode to check on the "Automatically save
buffer after reading inbox" switch, and low and behold, it was back to
saying "Yes"!

That was Bug number 2.  

I have now repeatedly set that line to "No", but every time I load my
zmail-init, it goes back to saying "Yes".  So it appears that here in
Release 7 I have no choice but to sit here watching the who-line and -wait-
for a background process, whenever I want to get another inbox.  Grumble.

Patches for conversion tool. (from SYS:CONVERSION-TOOLS;PATCHES.LISP.29), on Lisp Machine Pigpen:

OK, so I figured out that one of the two bugs I reported previously was
actually caused by the confusing user interface of Profile mode that
allowed me to repeatedly recompile my zmail-init without ever noticing that
it wasn't -writing- -out- the modified buffer!

So after getting background saving turned off I discover that Zmail's
behavior in that case is even worse, because now -whenever- I do a "G" it
drops me into the error handler.  I would have to remember to -always- type
"SG" if I wanted to get my inbox.  Barf.

I couple of other complaints:

I like new mail prepended to my mail file, reversed from the order it
appeared in my inbox.  That is, if my inbox contained messages:
  
  Message three
  Message two
  Message one

And my mail file started out:
  
  1 Old message one
  2 Old message two
  3 Old message three

Then after a Get Inbox I want my mail file to be:

  1 Message one
  2 Message two
  3 Message three  
  4 Old message one
  5 Old message two
  6 Old message three

I can achieve this effect in Release 7 in exactly the way I did in Release
6, -except- in Release 7 Get Inbox always leaves message #3 selected,
whereas in Release 6 message #1 was selected.  The Release 6 behavior is
the what I want (and is also what Babyl does).

Another Profile mode oddity I don't understand.  When I do an Insert
Changes, zmail always inserts the lines:

  (LOGIN-SETQ *DELETE-FROM-SITE-DONT-REPLY-TO-LIST*
	      '("BBOARD" "*MIT" "*MAC" "*LCS" "*OZ" "*AI" "ALL-AI" "7AI" "8AI" "9AI" "SYSTEM"))
  (LOGIN-SETQ *ADD-TO-SITE-DONT-REPLY-TO-LIST* '("Alan"))
  (LOGIN-SETQ *DONT-REPLY-TO* '("Alan"))

Now, I -did- ask for "Alan" to not be replied to somewhere in the moby list
of options, but there is nothing that I can see that even mentions a "Site
Dont Reply-To List".  And if I there -was- I certainly wouldn't ask to
-remove- that particular list of names, since in fact I don't ever want to
accidentally reply to those mailing lists!  

If ZMail is going to do this to everybody who updates their profile in
Release 7, it looks like the whole feature of having a list of
site-specific list not to reply to will be completely negated.  Lose lose.

    In Symbolics 3650 Zmail in Genera 7.1 on Lisp Machine Pigpen:

    [ So if I'm expected to mail bug reports that are to be -answered- to
      Customer-Reports, why did the C-M command automatically offer to send
      this mail to Bug-Zmail@OZ? ]

[ Because the debugger knows about some mailing lists and/or is told
  about them by the systems themselves.  Clearly, we should change this
  behavior to, in effect, disable generation of all Bug-XXX addresses at
  sites that don't have them.  (Or document what bug lists sites should
  setup.) ]

    What kind of a joke is the following?  I like to be able to get new mail
    whenever I want, but this is telling me that I have to -wait- for the
    background save to -finish- before I can get new mail?

No, it's telling you that you have to save the mail file before you can
read mail again.  Zmail doesn't care if the save is in the foreground or
background.  Typing #\Resume to take the first proceeed option will save
the mail file and then read the new mail.

							    What a screw!  I
    suppose my only option now is to turn off saving of my buffer after reading
    the inbox?  

No, this is irrelevant.

    How is this better than what it did in Release 6?  As I recall, it would
    simply hurry the background saver along before getting my new mail.  Why is
    throwing me into the error handler an improvement?

When I made this change for Release 7, I thought it would be better to
give the user a choice of what to do rather than always unconditionally
save the mail file.  Would you prefer that I change Zmail to have a
handler for this condition which asks a question instead of just going
straight to the debugger?

							Not only that, but I
    found the wording of the first two proceed options I was offered to be
    almost completely incomprehensible.
					 
Can you suggest better wording?  (If you think asking a question is
better above, can you suggest wording and possible names for answers to
the question?)

The first option will save the mail file and then proceed to read new
mail.  The second option will simply save the mail file and stop. 
(Typing "G" can, in theory, read more than one inbox at a time and you
might have to save after reading one before you can read a second.  This
is why the second option exists; it allows you to stop reading after the
first but be in position for another "G" without a subsequent error.)

					 And the other likely sounding proceed
    options, like "return to zmail toplevel" or whatever, didn't do anything
    useful since I still wasn't allowed to get my new mail!

    In Symbolics 3650 Zmail in Genera 7.1, 7-1-Patches 1.14, on Lisp Machine Pigpen:

    Oh wonderfull.  This is just dandy.  What fun.

    Ok, so I tried changing the thing in my profile called:
    "Automatically save buffer after reading inbox".  I tried to set it to be
    "No".  So in profile mode I clicked in the User Options menu to highlight
    the word "No" on the line labeled "Automatically save buffer after reading
    inbox".  The I clicked on "Insert Changes" and a line reading:

      (LOGIN-SETQ *INHIBIT-BACKGROUND-SAVES* T)

    was inserted in my zmail init.  (I think that's what changed, its always
    hard to tell just what it changes if you aren't looking closely.)  

Yes, that's what changed.

								       Then I
    clicked Middle on Save (Make profile compiled), and it saved, compiled, and
    loaded my zmail-init file.  Then I clicked on Exit.

As you have discovered in your later mail, mousing Middle on 1[Save]0 in
the profile editor simply recompiles the profile without saving it
first.  I have fixed this for 7.2; it will now ask if you want to save
the buffer before compiling and, if the file doesn't correspond to the
state in your profile editor, it will ask another question to make sure
you know what's going on.

    Now back in the main window, I typed "G" to pick up some mail from my
    inbox.  Strangely, zmail started saving my buffer in the background anyway.
    To see if the bug I previously reported was still present, I typed "G"
    again, and yes, the thing I complaind about before happened again.  OK, so
    I typed <Resume>, and it finished up the background save, and threw me into
    the debugger with the error message below.

    That was bug number 1.  

Unfortunately, the stack trace below isn't enough to debug this.  If
possible, can you send a 2describe0 of the buffer and its inboxes?
(You'll find the inboxes as part of the buffer's state.)

I think I've already fixed this one for 7.2 but can't be sure until I
get this additional information.

    Now I went back into Profile mode to check on the "Automatically save
    buffer after reading inbox" switch, and low and behold, it was back to
    saying "Yes"!

    That was Bug number 2.  

See above.

    I have now repeatedly set that line to "No", but every time I load my
    zmail-init, it goes back to saying "Yes".  So it appears that here in
    Release 7 I have no choice but to sit here watching the who-line and -wait-
    for a background process, whenever I want to get another inbox.  Grumble.

See my anwer to your previous complaint.  (To recap, in Genera 7.2,
1[Save (M)]0 will behave reasonably in that it will ask if you want to
save the buffer before trying to compile it.)

    So after getting background saving turned off I discover that Zmail's
    behavior in that case is even worse, because now -whenever- I do a "G" it
    drops me into the error handler.  I would have to remember to -always- type

    whereas in Release 6 message #1 was selected.  The Release 6 behavior is
    the what I want (and is also what Babyl does).

I've received this complaint several times before and agree that the
current behavior isn't acceptable.  I'm going to try to fix this in
Genera 7.2 but haven't succeeded as yet.  (I also intend to make the
inbox reversal happen sooner so that you won't be reading along and
suddenly find your mail flipping after it gets parsed in the background.)

    Another Profile mode oddity I don't understand.  When I do an Insert
    Changes, zmail always inserts the lines:

      (LOGIN-SETQ *DELETE-FROM-SITE-DONT-REPLY-TO-LIST*

    Dont Reply-To List".  And if I there -was- I certainly wouldn't ask to
    -remove- that particular list of names, since in fact I don't ever want to
    accidentally reply to those mailing lists!  

    If ZMail is going to do this to everybody who updates their profile in
    Release 7, it looks like the whole feature of having a list of
    site-specific list not to reply to will be completely negated.  Lose lose.

How did you ask for "Alan" to be excluded from replies?

The "People not to reply to" option in the profile editor starts out
initialized to the list setup by the site.  Any changes you make to that
option are assumed to be your personal preferences.  Therefore, if you
remove some entries that were in the list, we must presume that you want
to reply to those addresses even though the site thinks you don't want
to by default.

The same thing was true in Release 6.  The only difference is that with
Genera 7, we maintain the list of differences between your preferences
and site's default so that, if the site adds new entries, they are
automatically added to you list until you take explicit action on them.
In Release 6, once you edited the list, you gave up tracking the site's
list forever.

I got this while trying to do the DESCRIBE that Gary requested.  I had just
previously inadvertently Aborted out of the error he wanted me to
investigate, and the next time I did a "G" to reproduce the problem again,
this happened:

	Date: Thu, 4 Jun 87 17:27 EDT
	From: Alan Bawden <Alan@AI.AI.MIT.EDU>
	[ So if I'm expected to mail bug reports that are to be -answered- to
	  Customer-Reports, why did the C-M command automatically offer to send
	  this mail to Bug-Zmail@OZ? ]

    [ Because the debugger knows about some mailing lists and/or is told
      about them by the systems themselves.  Clearly, we should change this
      behavior to, in effect, disable generation of all Bug-XXX addresses at
      sites that don't have them.  (Or document what bug lists sites should
      setup.) ]

[ I think fixing this is harder than that.  The problem is that your policy
  for answering bug reports varies over time and from site to site.  The
  problem is not that Bug-Zmail@OZ doesn't exist.  The problem is that
  Symbolics has indicated that it feels free to ignore any bug reports sent
  to that list, so users who really -want- an answer should send their mail
  to a different place.  I suppose the ideal interface for MIT would be to
  pop up a menu that explains the choices ("Do you want your bug report
  answered, or do you want to mail it directly to the maintainers, or
  both?")  The only way I can see that your software could anticipate this
  is to run some site-specific -code- for each possible class of bugs the
  user might want to report. ]

	What kind of a joke is the following?  I like to be able to get new mail
	whenever I want, but this is telling me that I have to -wait- for the
	background save to -finish- before I can get new mail?

    No, it's telling you that you have to save the mail file before you can
    read mail again.  Zmail doesn't care if the save is in the foreground or
    background.  Typing #\Resume to take the first proceeed option will save
    the mail file and then read the new mail.

So in effect, if I want to avoid the debugger, I have to look in the
who-line, and if I seen my inbox being saved, I have to -wait- for it to
finish before I can type "G".

								What a screw!  I
	suppose my only option now is to turn off saving of my buffer after reading
	the inbox?  

    No, this is irrelevant.

No, it certainly was relevant since it seemed like a possible way I could
live with the problem until Release 8.  I hoped perhaps that turning off
saving would allow me to Get Inbox again -without- being forced to do a
save.  But as I discovered later it only made matters more annoying, in
that if you do this you find yourself in the debugger even more often.

	How is this better than what it did in Release 6?  As I recall, it would
	simply hurry the background saver along before getting my new mail.  Why is
	throwing me into the error handler an improvement?

    When I made this change for Release 7, I thought it would be better to
    give the user a choice of what to do rather than always unconditionally
    save the mail file.  Would you prefer that I change Zmail to have a
    handler for this condition which asks a question instead of just going
    straight to the debugger?

No, I don't want it to bother me about it at all!  I there are people who
really like being offered these options, then lets have (yet another)
switch that we can set in out init files.  And I'll set it to do what it
used to do in Rel6.  (I don't have much sympathy for a theory of user
interface in which the user always finds himself in the debugger if he
gives commands in the "wrong" order.)

							    Not only that, but I
	found the wording of the first two proceed options I was offered to be
	almost completely incomprehensible.
					 
    Can you suggest better wording?  (If you think asking a question is
    better above, can you suggest wording and possible names for answers to
    the question?)

    The first option will save the mail file and then proceed to read new
    mail.  The second option will simply save the mail file and stop. 
    (Typing "G" can, in theory, read more than one inbox at a time and you
    might have to save after reading one before you can read a second.  This
    is why the second option exists; it allows you to stop reading after the
    first but be in position for another "G" without a subsequent error.)

Thanks for explaining, but I still don't understand what the second option
is for.  What does the fact that "G" can read more than one inbox have to
do with it?  If my buffer -wasn't- being saved in the background, what
would "G" have done about those multiple inboxes?  Would it have offered me
a choice of which one to read in?  In any case, what's wrong with:

  S-A:	Finish saving buffer, then get inbox
  S-B:  Finish saving buffer, but skip getting inbox

The confusing part of the existing message is that it talks about
"Inserting" something.  As a simple user of zmail, the notion of
"insertion" isn't one that I am familiar with.

    As you have discovered in your later mail, mousing Middle on 1[Save]0 in
    the profile editor simply recompiles the profile without saving it
    first.  I have fixed this for 7.2; it will now ask if you want to save
    the buffer before compiling and, if the file doesn't correspond to the
    state in your profile editor, it will ask another question to make sure
    you know what's going on.

Good.  This interface could use a lot of work.  Like the most common
operation would seem to be:  Insert Changes, then Save, then Compile.  I
wish that one click on Save would do exactly that (-without- asking me any
questions or anything like that).

	Now back in the main window, I typed "G" to pick up some mail from my
	inbox.  Strangely, zmail started saving my buffer in the background anyway.
	To see if the bug I previously reported was still present, I typed "G"
	again, and yes, the thing I complaind about before happened again.  OK, so
	I typed <Resume>, and it finished up the background save, and threw me into
	the debugger with the error message below.

	That was bug number 1.  

    Unfortunately, the stack trace below isn't enough to debug this.  If
    possible, can you send a 2describe0 of the buffer and its inboxes?
    (You'll find the inboxes as part of the buffer's state.)

    I think I've already fixed this one for 7.2 but can't be sure until I
    get this additional information.

Being rather long, these follow at the end of this message.

	I couple of other complaints: ...

	Then after a Get Inbox I want my mail file to be:

	  1 Message one
	  2 Message two
	  3 Message three  
	  4 Old message one
	  5 Old message two
	  6 Old message three

	I can achieve this effect in Release 7 in exactly the way I did in Release
	6, -except- in Release 7 Get Inbox always leaves message #3 selected,
	whereas in Release 6 message #1 was selected.  The Release 6 behavior is
	the what I want (and is also what Babyl does).

    I've received this complaint several times before and agree that the
    current behavior isn't acceptable.  I'm going to try to fix this in
    Genera 7.2 but haven't succeeded as yet.  (I also intend to make the
    inbox reversal happen sooner so that you won't be reading along and
    suddenly find your mail flipping after it gets parsed in the background.)

Gee, does that inbox reversal screw still happen?  I haven't noticed it for
quite some time so I had assumed that something was changed for Rel6 that
fixed it.  (It seemed like it took me years to convince Symbolics that it
was a screw to have your mail buffer asynchronously reversed, and I'd be
dissapointed to learn that I never really penetrated with that complaint.)

	Another Profile mode oddity I don't understand.  When I do an Insert
	Changes, zmail always inserts the lines:

	  (LOGIN-SETQ *DELETE-FROM-SITE-DONT-REPLY-TO-LIST*
		      '("BBOARD" "*MIT" "*MAC" "*LCS" "*OZ" "*AI" "ALL-AI" "7AI" "8AI" "9AI" "SYSTEM"))
	  (LOGIN-SETQ *ADD-TO-SITE-DONT-REPLY-TO-LIST* '("Alan"))
	  (LOGIN-SETQ *DONT-REPLY-TO* '("Alan"))

	Now, I -did- ask for "Alan" to not be replied to somewhere in the moby list
	of options, but there is nothing that I can see that even mentions a "Site
	Dont Reply-To List".  And if I there -was- I certainly wouldn't ask to
	-remove- that particular list of names, since in fact I don't ever want to
	accidentally reply to those mailing lists!  

	If ZMail is going to do this to everybody who updates their profile in
	Release 7, it looks like the whole feature of having a list of
	site-specific list not to reply to will be completely negated.  Lose lose.

    How did you ask for "Alan" to be excluded from replies?

    The "People not to reply to" option in the profile editor starts out
    initialized to the list setup by the site.  Any changes you make to that
    option are assumed to be your personal preferences.  Therefore, if you
    remove some entries that were in the list, we must presume that you want
    to reply to those addresses even though the site thinks you don't want
    to by default.

    The same thing was true in Release 6.  The only difference is that with
    Genera 7, we maintain the list of differences between your preferences
    and site's default so that, if the site adds new entries, they are
    automatically added to you list until you take explicit action on them.
    In Release 6, once you edited the list, you gave up tracking the site's
    list forever.

At some point in the dim past the line

  (LOGIN-SETQ *DONT-REPLY-TO* '("Alan"))

was inserted into my zmail init.  In Rel4 for all I know.  Perhaps before
their even -was- a Site Dont Reply To List.  Probably I was in Profile mode
and saw "People not to reply to:" and thought I would add my name to that
empty list.  I haven't -touched- that field in recent memory.  The first
time I did Insert Changes in Rel7 the other stuff appeared.

I have manually fixed my Zmail init to -only- contain the line:

  (LOGIN-SETQ *ADD-TO-SITE-DONT-REPLY-TO-LIST* '("Alan")).

This is my best guess as to what I really want.

Here are the promised descriptions.

	    [ So if I'm expected to mail bug reports that are to be -answered- to
	      Customer-Reports, why did the C-M command automatically offer to send
	      this mail to Bug-Zmail@OZ? ]

	[ Because the debugger knows about some mailing lists and/or is told
	  about them by the systems themselves.  Clearly, we should change this
	  behavior to, in effect, disable generation of all Bug-XXX addresses at
	  sites that don't have them.  (Or document what bug lists sites should
	  setup.) ]

    [ I think fixing this is harder than that.  The problem is that your policy
      for answering bug reports varies over time and from site to site.  The
      problem is not that Bug-Zmail@OZ doesn't exist.  The problem is that
      Symbolics has indicated that it feels free to ignore any bug reports sent
      to that list, so users who really -want- an answer should send their mail
      to a different place.  I suppose the ideal interface for MIT would be to
      pop up a menu that explains the choices ("Do you want your bug report
      answered, or do you want to mail it directly to the maintainers, or
      both?")  The only way I can see that your software could anticipate this
      is to run some site-specific -code- for each possible class of bugs the
      user might want to report. ]

Our policy is that customer mail which comes to customer-reports is
answered and customer mail which comes to bug-foo may or may not be.
This is because there are people who are payed to deal with customer
mail who read customer-reports, while those who read bug-foo are more
interested in things in the latest development system.  Because this is
the policy, we've suggested to people at MIT several times that they
change bug-foo@MIT to forward to customer-reports@symbolics rather than
bug-foo@symbolics.  These suggestions have been ignored.  I think it's a
reasonable assumption for the system to make that bug-foo at a given
site is the right place to send bug reports.  The problem is that at
MIT, it isn't.  It should be changed so that it is.

I think this is just a restatement of what I said myself.  Please notice
that I'm not trying to complain about this policy.  I'm just expressing a
concern about the relationship between this policy, and the bug report
generating software that you have given us.

							    Because this is
    the policy, we've suggested to people at MIT several times that they
    change bug-foo@MIT to forward to customer-reports@symbolics rather than
    bug-foo@symbolics.  These suggestions have been ignored.

(I have been unable to find anyone here at MIT that can recall anyone at
Symbolics ever making this suggestion.  Of course, since we have no
"official" administration of our installation of Symbolics machines, there
is no one who necessarily feels that it is his responsibility to make
decisions about things like this, so its not clear who you should have
suggested this too.)

							      I think it's a
    reasonable assumption for the system to make that bug-foo at a given
    site is the right place to send bug reports.  The problem is that at
    MIT, it isn't.  It should be changed so that it is.

Here we finally get to the heart of the matter, and here is where you miss
my point.  My point is that at MIT there are -three- ways that a particular
piece of bug mail can be addressed:

  1.  Customer-Reports
  2.  Bug-Foo
  3.  Bug-Foo, Customer-Reports

Currently 2 is the default.  You claim that Symbolics officially suggests
that 1 be the default (by the mechanism of making Bug-Foo@<local-site>
forward mail to Customer-Reports@Symbolics.COM).  

But no matter what the -defualt- is, apparently we are all in agreement
that I have the -option- of choosing one of the other possibilities.
Correct?  (If, in fact, you believe otherwise, then I wonder why you simply
don't make it be the case that Bug-Foo@Symbolics.COM just be the same as
Customer-Reports@Symbolics.COM, and be done with it.)

I was simply suggesting that it would be nice, from a user interface point
of view, if something that happened after I typed C-M to the debugger,
would offer me a -choice- between these options.

Now since I can imagine that at -other- sites they might have other
preferences about how their user community should report bugs, I was
suggesting that what you might do about my suggestion is to provide a hook
of some kind so that sites can use to -customize- this behavior.

								Because this is
	the policy, we've suggested to people at MIT several times that they
	change bug-foo@MIT to forward to customer-reports@symbolics rather than
	bug-foo@symbolics.  These suggestions have been ignored.

    (I have been unable to find anyone here at MIT that can recall anyone at
    Symbolics ever making this suggestion.  Of course, since we have no
    "official" administration of our installation of Symbolics machines, there
    is no one who necessarily feels that it is his responsibility to make
    decisions about things like this, so its not clear who you should have
    suggested this too.)

I always assumed this was true, and even thought of going in and
changing it myself, but then I thought, "Why should I make more work for
myself?" so I didn't.

								  I think it's a
	reasonable assumption for the system to make that bug-foo at a given
	site is the right place to send bug reports.  The problem is that at
	MIT, it isn't.  It should be changed so that it is.

    Here we finally get to the heart of the matter, and here is where you miss
    my point.  My point is that at MIT there are -three- ways that a particular
    piece of bug mail can be addressed:

      1.  Customer-Reports
      2.  Bug-Foo
      3.  Bug-Foo, Customer-Reports

    Currently 2 is the default.  You claim that Symbolics officially suggests
    that 1 be the default (by the mechanism of making Bug-Foo@<local-site>
    forward mail to Customer-Reports@Symbolics.COM).  

Actually, we would prefer, and at most customer sites it is, that
bug-foo go to some local person who filters bugs and then redistributes
them to us.  The "official" policy states that we ignore mail from
everybody other than the "primary contact" at a site.  In actuality, if
more than one person sends mail from a site, we deal with it, but don't
tell management that.

    But no matter what the -defualt- is, apparently we are all in agreement
    that I have the -option- of choosing one of the other possibilities.
    Correct?  (If, in fact, you believe otherwise, then I wonder why you simply
    don't make it be the case that Bug-Foo@Symbolics.COM just be the same as
    Customer-Reports@Symbolics.COM, and be done with it.)

Because bug-foo@symbolics is used for bug reports in the current
in-house system.  Even in-house, anyone who is using released software
tends to send their questions to customer-reports and we either deal
with it, or, after verifying that it's still a problem in the current
in-house system, forward it there with a note saying that it's still
broken.

    I was simply suggesting that it would be nice, from a user interface point
    of view, if something that happened after I typed C-M to the debugger,
    would offer me a -choice- between these options.

    Now since I can imagine that at -other- sites they might have other
    preferences about how their user community should report bugs, I was
    suggesting that what you might do about my suggestion is to provide a hook
    of some kind so that sites can use to -customize- this behavior.

Are there any variables in your zmail profile that affect
this?  Does clicking on Use Original for the variable *send-
header-format* get you anywhere?  What kind of a header does
Zmail insert after throwing away the originals?  I understand
how Zmail modifies headers, but not what kind of problem it's
causing you.

    In Symbolics 3650 Zmail in Genera 7.1 on Lisp Machine Pigpen:

    How can I prevent ZMail from inserting the line:

      No Original: Save Original

    In the header of my Babyl file?  I have determined by experiment that
    having this present causes Babyl to throw away the original
    (un-reformatted) headers of my messages.

Sigh.  When I first made this change, I was told that Babyl would ignore
values for the 1No Original0 option that it didn't understand.  Obviously,
this was wrong.  (I sure wish I had an ITS and a TOPS-20 on which to
test these things.)

					      Apparently ZMail also throws away
    these original headers, even if there isn't such a line, and then it
    inserts such a line to insure that I will be screwed the next time I use
    Babyl.

Are you sure that Zmail throws away the original headers?  I know that
many people here use Babyl files and Zmail doesn't flush the original
headers for them so I find this difficult to believe.

    I presume there must be some way to get ZMail to -save- the original
    headers, but I can't find any switch (per-user or per-mailfile) that
    controls this behavior.

    I am reduced to using an editor to correct my Babyl file every time ZMail
    touches it.

Here's what you can do to avoid this problem --

Edit your Babyl file's header to contain the line

    Reformat-Headers-P: Save Both

(You'll find right now that it says just "Reformat-Headers-P".)  This
change will cause Zmail to save both just as Babyl does and will stop
Zmail from adding the 1No Original0 option that's causing all this grief.

In the development system, I've changed Zmail's implementation of these
reformatting options so that, when you specify reformatting for a file,
Zmail will save only the originals but will instruct Babyl to save both.
I'm pretty certain that this will work but, as I have no access to a
Babyl, can't be positive.  Could you please try this out for me?

Here's the patched function:

2    ;=====================================
    (SYSTEM-INTERNALS:BEGIN-PATCH-SECTION)
    (SYSTEM-INTERNALS:PATCH-SECTION-SOURCE-FILE "SYS:ZMAIL;FOREIGN-MAIL-FILE-FORMATS.LISP.8")

     "-*- Mode:LISP; Package:ZWEI; Base:8 -*-")
    
    ;;; Make sure that the three reformatting options are consistent.
    (DEFUN RATIONALIZE-REFORMATTING-OPTIONS (PLIST)
     (LET ((REFORMAT-HEADERS-P-PRESENT (GETL PLIST '(:REFORMAT-HEADERS-P))))
       (IF REFORMAT-HEADERS-P-PRESENT
	    ;; Reformat-Headers-P overrides the older No Reformation and No Original options.
	    (LET ((REFORMAT-HEADERS-P (GET PLIST :REFORMAT-HEADERS-P)))
	     (SELECTQ REFORMAT-HEADERS-P
	       (:SAVE-BOTH
	       ;; Save both the original and reformatted headers --
	       ;;    Not a selectable option but provided for compatibility with Babyl itself.
	       (PUTPROP PLIST NIL :|NO REFORMATION|)
	       (PUTPROP PLIST NIL :|NO ORIGINAL|))
	       (NIL				
	       ;; Don't reformat the headers at all.
	       (PUTPROP PLIST T :|NO REFORMATION|)
	       (PUTPROP PLIST NIL :|NO ORIGINAL|))
	       (T
	       ;; Reformat the headers but save only the originals in the mail file --
	       ;;    If Babyl sees any value for the No Original option, it will never
	       ;;    save the original headers.  Therefore, we'll set No Original to
	       ;;    indicate that both the original and reformatted headers should be
	       ;;    saved.  Only Babyl itself will actually save both; Zmail will
	       ;;    continue to save only the original headers.  As each message indicates
	       ;;    whether/not it's reformatted in the file, this is OK.
	       (PUTPROP PLIST NIL :|NO REFORMATION|)
	       (PUTPROP PLIST NIL :|NO ORIGINAL|))))
	;; Reformat-Headers-P isn't present --
	;;    Compute it from the older No Reformation and No Original options for compatibility.
	(LET ((NO-REFORMATION (GET PLIST :|NO REFORMATION|))
	       (NO-ORIGINAL (GET PLIST :|NO ORIGINAL|)))
	    (IF NO-REFORMATION
	       ;; No reformatting -- Ignore the setting of No Original.
	       (PUTPROP PLIST NIL :REFORMAT-HEADERS-P)
	     (SELECTQ NO-ORIGINAL
	       (:SAVE-ORIGINAL
	       ;; Reformat for display but save the original headers.
	       (PUTPROP PLIST T :REFORMAT-HEADERS-P))
	       (NIL				
	       ;; Save both the original and reformatted headers.
	       (PUTPROP PLIST :SAVE-BOTH :REFORMAT-HEADERS-P))
	       (T
	       ;; Save only the reformatted headers --
	       ;;    We don't honor this option as it would prevent conversations from working.
	       ;;    Therefore, we treat this as equivalent to Save Original.
	       (PUTPROP PLIST T :REFORMAT-HEADERS-P))))))))

0Let me know how this works out.

Situation:  Lispm at MCC, Austin, TX.  Also present at site is a Tops-20
(mcc.com) where I have a babyl file which used to be my everyday mail
file.  (This babyl file was in a separate buffer at the time.) I was
trying to get new mail from ai.ai.mit.edu, an ITS at MIT.  I had just
created a babyl file there, and had sent myself a message and gotten it.
I then did "get inbox" again as a test.  Usually (for twenexes, anyway)
it says no new mail, etc.  This time, it barfed, saying that
"ai:maeda;maeda mail" did not exist.

I know I'm not supposed to conjecture at the cause of the bug, but...

Why didn't Zmail check to see if the file existed before it tried to
rename it?  Is this a bug with ITS connections?  (My mail files have
always been on twenexes before.)  

This machine was also running a specially frobbed namespace so it could
talk to MIT.  e.g.  MIT hosts are not on the local namespace and were
added locally (in my init file).  

please send all replies to maeda@ai.ai.mit.edu

    Situation:  Lispm at MCC, Austin, TX.  Also present at site is a Tops-20
    (mcc.com) where I have a babyl file which used to be my everyday mail
    file.  (This babyl file was in a separate buffer at the time.) I was
    trying to get new mail from ai.ai.mit.edu, an ITS at MIT.  I had just
    created a babyl file there, and had sent myself a message and gotten it.
    I then did "get inbox" again as a test.  Usually (for twenexes, anyway)
    it says no new mail, etc.  This time, it barfed, saying that
    "ai:maeda;maeda mail" did not exist.

    I know I'm not supposed to conjecture at the cause of the bug, but...

    Why didn't Zmail check to see if the file existed before it tried to
    rename it?  Is this a bug with ITS connections?  (My mail files have
    always been on twenexes before.)  

This beahvior is caused by a deficiency in our (Symbolics') TCP FTP
implementation.  In particular, our TCP FTP does not support 1probe-file
0unless the server machine is a TOPS-20, Unix, or Multics.  For all other
servers (including ITS and LispMs), our TCP FTP will always claim that
the file exists when using 1probe-file0!  And that's why Zmail blows up
trying to rename a non-existant file.

I'll talk to our TCP FTP maintainer tomorrow and, hopefully, we'll be
able to fix this situation in Genera 7.2.  (And possibly provide a patch
for you.)

In the meantime, I've added a kludge to Zmail for 7.2 to get around this
lossage.  Said kludge is included as part of this message so that you
can add it as a patch at your site.

    This machine was also running a specially frobbed namespace so it could
    talk to MIT.  e.g.  MIT hosts are not on the local namespace and were
    added locally (in my init file).  

    please send all replies to maeda@ai.ai.mit.edu
