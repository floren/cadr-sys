Also, when printing file dates, the year is supposed to always be printed as

  (4 "(Patch is from Jim O'Dell when he was at Los Alamos:)

   When communicating from a symbolics to a lambda, the symbolics side
   often does a  CHAOS:OPEN and passes an :ESTIMATED-SIZE keyword to 
   the lambda, which is not recognized.
   The lambda side should parse this in FS:FILE-SERVER-OPEN, along with the
   other options,  and just ignore it.
Done." "pld" NIL)

an error \"No pathname given\", which was a complete lie." "pld" NIL)

using a keyword argument: :error nil.  The operations wanted a simple
