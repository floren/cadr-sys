but now it says
  .... (xxx pages used in ~;)" "pld" NIL)
  (2 "The (:METHOD FS:LM-DATA-STREAM-MIXIN :RENAME) didn't used to return an
error condition, and the file-server expected it to when ERROR-P is NIL.
So, in that case only, we return an error condition; otherwise we always
return the file TRUENAME.

This fixes the following bug: when you renamed a remote file across
directories, instead of getting an error, the operation appeared to
succeed; the \"truename\" returned was the old, original name.  Now,
the file server passes the error on to the local user, who gets
a proceedable error, and can in most environments specify a new pathname." "keith" NIL)
