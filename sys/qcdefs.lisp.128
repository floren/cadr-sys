L-ENVIRONMENT :UNBOUND
  "Intended lexical variable environment of the function being compiled.
For a top-level function in a file, it is NIL.
In general it is a list of VARS lists, to be scanned in the order listed.
Each element corresponds to one environment level,
and the position of a variable home within the element
is its index within that level.
The level number and the index within the level are the two quantities
that are passed to %LOCATE-IN-HIGHER-CONTEXT.")
