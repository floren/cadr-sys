;A PATHSTRING is a string form of description of a route through the hierarchy.
;The simplest kind is a sequence of node names separated by "\" or "/" characters.
;"/" is cleaner, but is a pain to use, so for now "\" is the usual choice.
;This pathstring refers to the node which is reached by the sequence of
;subnodes with those names, down from the root.
;"#" introduces a version spec, which can follow any node name or property.
;"^" in a pathstring refers to the supernode of the node reached by
;the path up to that point.
;"|" in a pathstring introduces a property name.  This refers to the node
;which is that property of the node specified by the path up to that point.
;The property name can be followed by "#" and a version spec.
;"~" in a pathstring refers to the root node, regardless of what comes before.

;Pathstrings can be divided arbitrarily into a directory and a name.
;This division is written as <directory>; <name> or as
;<name>  <directory>.  The division has no effect on which node is
;specified by the pathstring, because the directory and name are effectively
;concatenated.  However, certain pathname operations which modify the pathstring
;modify it in a way which depends on the division into directory and name.

;A PATHNAME is an instance which remembers pathlists for the directory and name.
;Pathnames can be sent messages to open files, etc.

;A PATHLIST is a partially parsed version of a pathstring.
;A pathlist is a list of pathsteps.  Each pathstep
;represents one step in a chain of nodes leading to the desired one.

;PATHSTEPs:  A pathstep is understood by a directory to identify
;a subnode, or a possible subnode, of the directory.
;This mapping need not be 1 to 1: many different pathsteps
;can identify the same subnode.  Also, which subnode is identified
;by a given pathstep can depend on what other subnodes exist
;(This happens for pathsteps with version ">" or "<", among others).
;There are some formats of pathstep which have a standard meaning.
;Other formats can be freely used in any way at all by any
;specific flavor of directory.

;Ordinarily a pathstep is a list
;whose car is a symbol saying what kind of pathstep it is.
;A couple of kinds of pathstep are standard,
;and others may be defined for a particular flavor of directory.
;A pathstep can also be an unparsed string, in which case the
;VALIDATE-PATHSTEP operation should parse it into an equivalent 
;(possibly flavor-specific) list.
;Unparsed strings still contain their quoting characters.
;A pathstep can also be symbol, but only certain symbols are allowed.
;The symbols allowed in a pathstep are:
; the symbol SUPERNODE, meaning the supernode of the preceding;
; the symbol ROOT, meaning the root node.
;These symbols can appear in pathlists of pathnames,
;but they are processed at a high level.
;Directories never receive them and do not understand them.
;They do not appear in pathnames that are truenames.

;These are the standard kinds of pathstep lists:
;(:VERSION pathstep version-spec) specifies a version of a file.
;This sort of pathstep is standard so that version numbers in pathnames
;can be manipulated without opening the directory.
;The cadr of this list is again a pathstep, 
;either a list or an unparsed string, never ROOT or SUPERNODE.
;(:MULTIPLE-NAMES name name ...) specifies several filenames.
;Each name is actually a pathstep, but most kinds of pathsteps,
;including :VERSION, :PROPERTY and :MULTIPLE-NAMES, do not make
;sense in this context and are not allowed.
;(:SUBNODE-PROPERTY pathstep propname version-spec)
;specifies a node identified as being a property of one of our subnodes.
;(:PROPERTY propname version-spec)
;specifies a property of the node specified so far.
;This is generated only for a property at the front of a name,
;or following "^".

;:SUBNODE-PROPERTY and :MULTIPLE-NAMES are pretty much
;different ways of doing similar things.  It is not clear yet
;which of them is the right thing for common constructs to use.
;Right now, dirs understand all three, so we can experiment
;with which one pathnames should use.

;A FULL-PATHSTEP is a pathstep that is completely parsed
;and which describes a particular subnode independent of what
;happens to other subnodes.  For example, it contains a version
;number which is actually a positive number, not > or <.
;Each subnode's dir-entry contains a full-pathstep for that subnode.

;A STANDARD-PATHSTEP is like a full-pathstep in that it clearly
;specifies a particular subnode, but instead of being fully parsed,
;it can use standard kinds of lists, and unparsed strings.
;The pathlist of a truename contains only standard pathsteps.
;The pathlist of any pathname contains only standard pathsteps,
;and the symbols ROOT and SUPERNODE.

;The Lisp machine pathname system was designed on the assumption
;that all file systems are Twenex.  A file system with different
;concepts needs crocks to interface to it.

;A lmfile-parsing-mixin remembers its information
;for the most part as a pathlist.
;However, this pathlist is divided (arbitrarily, by the user)
;into two parts, the "directory" and the "name" of the pathname.
;These are concatenated to get the pathlist of the file to be
;opened.

;Further exception: the last pathstep never has a version number.
;Instead, the "version" of the pathname is what ought to be
;its version number.  When it the actual pathlist is needed,
;this version number must be merged into the "name".

;Similarly, the "name" never ends with a subnode-property pathstep.
;When it would be expected to do so, instead the "type" of the
;pathname holds the property which is the last pathstep.
;When we want the actual pathlist to use, this must be merged in.

;Here we merge the "name", "type" and "version" into a pathlist
;which could be appended to the "directory" and then opened.
