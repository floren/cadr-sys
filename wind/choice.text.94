.chapter Choice Facilities
.setq choice-chapter chapter-number

The window system contains several facilities to allow the user to make
choices.  These all work by displaying some arrangement of choices in a
window.  By pointing to one with the mouse the user can select it.  The
details (how the choices are specified, what the user interaction looks
like, and what happens when a choice is selected) vary widely, which is why
there are several separate facilities. 

Each choice facility is implemented as a family of window flavors, providing
several variations on the basic facility.  For those who don't want to create
their own window, each facility provides an easy-to-use function interface
that temporarily pops up a window of the appropriate flavor.  The function
interfaces will be described first in each section.  Following the function
interfaces there is documentation on how to create and use a window which
has the facility.

This document does not cover how to modify these facilities to provide your
own specialized versions, except in the simplest ways.  That is certainly
a reasonable thing to want to do.  In order to do it you will need to read
some of the code that implements the facility in question, for instance to
learn about window instance variables and about internal operations that you
might want to redefine or put daemons on.

Some portions of these facilities execute in the process that calls
them, while other portions execute in the mouse process.  All Lisp
evaluation with which the user is concerned takes place in the user's
process when using the facilities described in this document, with a
very few exceptions which are noted when they occur.
Thus the user may freely use side-effects (both special variables and
3*throw*) and need not worry that an error in his program
will interfere with mouse tracking.

.section Menus
.setq menu section-page
.cindex menus

A menu is an array of choices, each identified by a word or short phrase.
You can select one of the choices by moving the mouse near it, which causes
it to be highlighted (a box appears around it), and then clicking any mouse button.

What happens when you select one of the choices depends on the particular
type of menu.  Typically the choices in a menu might be commands to
some program or choices for what a command should operate upon.

The system automatically chooses the arrangement of the choices and the
size and shape of the window.  Naturally there are ways for the user to
control this if necessary.

To see an example of a menu, click the right-hand mouse button twice,
causing the system menu to appear.

.subsection Menu Items
.cindex menu items
.setq menu-items section-page

A menu has a list of items; each item represents one of the choices offered.
An item tells the menu what to display and what to do if the user selects
(clicks on) it.  "What to do" specifies both what value to return and a possible
side effect.

Response to selection of an item is implemented by the 3:execute*
operation, which is always sent in the user process (rather than the mouse
process).  Thus side effects occur in the appropriate process.  The
returned value comes back to the user from 3tv:menu-choose*,
3:choose*, or 3:execute* depending on how the menu is used.  This
will be explained in detail later.

.nopara
An item can take any of the following forms:
.table 1
.item a string or a symbol
The string or symbol is both what is displayed and what is returned.  There
are no side-effects.

.item a cons 3(2name* . 2atom*)*
2name* (a symbol or a string) is what to display, and 2atom*
is what to return.  There are no side-effects.

.item a list 3(2name* 2value*)*
2name* is a string or a symbol to display, and 2value* is any
arbitrary object to return.  There are no side-effects.

.item a list 3(2name* 2type* 2arg* 2option1* 2arg1* 2option2* 2arg2...*)*
This is the most general form.  2name* is a string or a symbol to display.
2type* is a keyword symbol specifying what to do, and 2arg* is an
argument to it.  The 2options* are keyword symbols specifying additional
features desired, and the 2args* following them are arguments to those options.
.end_table

If 3nil* is supplied as a menu item, it is ignored completely.
It takes up no space in the menu.

A list of items is sometimes called an "item alist" since most forms
of menu item look like alist elements mapping strings into what to do
about them.

.nopara
The possible values of 2type* in the most general form of menu item are:
.table 3
.xitem :value "menu item type"
2arg* is what to return.  There are no side-effects.

.xitem :eval "menu item type"
2arg* is a form to be evaluated.  Its value is returned.

.xitem :funcall "menu item type"
2arg* is a function of no arguments to be called.  The value it returns is returned.

.xitem :no-select "menu item type"
This item cannot be selected.  Moving the mouse near it will 2not* cause it to be
highlighted.  This is useful for putting comments, headings, and blank spaces into
menus.  2arg* is ignored, but must be present to make the item be the form that
has a 2type* keyword in it.

.xitem :kbd "menu item type"
'cindex blip types
2arg* is sent to the selected window via the 3:force-kbd-input*
operation.  Typically it is either a character code, which is to be
treated as if it were typed in from the keyboard, or a list (a blip),
which is a command to the program (see (blips)).  Use of 3:kbd*
produces an effect like the effect of using a command menu (see
(command-menu)).

.xitem :menu "menu item type"
2arg* is a new menu to choose from; it is sent a 3:choose* message and the result
is returned.  Normally 2arg* would be a pop-up menu.  If 2arg* is a symbol
it gets evaluated.

.xitem :menu-choose "menu item type"
2arg* is a list (2label* . 2menu-items*).  The car and cdr
are passed as arguments to 3tv:menu-choose*, popping up another menu,
and the result of choosing from that menu is returned.
2menu-items* is another list of menu items.

.xitem :buttons "menu item type"
2arg* is a list of three menu items.  The item actually chosen
(i.e. the item to be executed) is one of these three, depending on which mouse
button was clicked.  The order in the list is 3(2left* 2middle* 2right*)*.  The three menu items in the list will be used only
for execution, not for display, so it does not matter what they
have as the string to be displayed (it can be 3nil*), and
there is no point in giving them 3:font* or 3:documentation* keywords.
These should go in the main menu item, the one that contains
the 3:buttons*.

.xitem :window-op "menu item type"
2arg* is a function of one argument.  The argument is a list of three
elements: the window the mouse was in before this menu was popped-up and
the 2x* and 2y* coordinates of the mouse at that time.  This item
type is handled by the 3:execute-window-op* menu operation,
which the flavor 3tv:menu* does not implement.
The flavor 3tv:window-hacking-menu-mixin* provides a method to
implement it.
.end_table

.nopara
The menu item modifier keywords are:
.table 3
.xitem :font "menu item type"
This keyword is followed by a font or a symbol that is the name of a font.
The item is displayed in that font instead of the menu's default font.

.xitem :documentation "menu item type"
This keyword is followed by a string, which briefly describes this menu item.
When the mouse is pointing at this item, so that it is highlighted, the
documentation string will be displayed in the documentation line at the bottom
of the screen.

.xitem :bindings "menu item type"
This keyword is followed by a list of bindings to be made, suitable for
passing to the function 3progw* (see (progw-fun)).  These bindings
are made before evaluating, funcalling, sending a message to a window,
etc.  If 3:buttons* is used with 3:bindings*, the 3:bindings* must
appear inside the menu item within the 3:buttons* to have an effect on
the final result.
.end_table

Here are some examples of menu item lists:

Three items, that display as 3FOO*, 3BAR* and 3LOSE*,
and return the symbols 3foo*, 3bar* and 3lose* when chosen.
.lisp
(foo bar lose)
.end_lisp

Another way of specifying the same thing, using more general syntax:
.lisp
(("FOO" :value foo) 
 ("BAR" :value bar)
 ("LOSE" :value lose))
.end_lisp

Putting 3FOO* in italics and adding documentation for the who line:
.lisp
(("FOO" :value foo :font fonts:tr12i
  :documentation "Choose to FOO")
 ("BAR" :value bar
  :documentation "Request a BAR")
 ("LOSE" :value lose
  :documentation "Don't win."))
.end_lisp

Some other type keywords are used here.
The value of the 3:choose* operation will be
a keyword such as 3:read* or 3:write*,
the value returned by the function 3read*,
or whatever the 3buffer-op-menu* returns.
.lisp
(("File" :buttons
  ((nil :value :read)
   (nil :value :write)
   (nil :menu-choose
    ("File Operation"
     1;; Item list of menu obtained for click-right on 3File*.*
     ("Read" :value ;read
      ;documentation "Read a file")
     ("Write" :value ;write
      ;documentation "Write a file")
     ("Rename" :value ;rename
      ;documentation "Rename a file")
     ("Delete" :value ;delete
      ;documentation "Delete a file"))))
  :documentation
  "L: Read file.  M: Write file.  R: Menu.")
 1;; The following makes a blank line in a one-column menu.*
 ("" :no-select nil)
 1;; We assume that 3buffer-op-menu* is a variable whose value is a menu.*
 ("Buffer" :menu buffer-op-menu
  :documentation "Operate on this buffer")
 ("Read" :buttons
  ((nil :eval (read))
   (nil :eval (read)
    :bindings ((base 10.)))
   nil)
  ;documentation
  "L: Read sexp.  M: Read sexp, base ten."))
.end_lisp

Here we show the use of 3:bindings*.  This expression
creates a menu item which contains a host taken from
the local variable 3host*.
When the menu item is chosen, the function 3hack-host*
will be called with the appropriate host as the value of
the special variable 3host-to-hack*.
.lisp
`(("Hack This Host" :funcall hack-host
   :bindings ((host-to-hack ',host))
   :documentation "Do some hacks to this host."))
.end_lisp

.defflavor tv:menu-execute-mixin
This flavor defines the 3:execute* operation to process a menu item
according to the rules described above.
.end_defflavor

.defmethod tv:menu-execute-mixin :execute item
Processes 2item*, computing and returning the "value to return"
according to the rules described above.  Everything about the meaning of menu items,
except as far as it affects displaying the menu, is determined by what the
3:execute* operation does, so by redefining this operation you can
implement new types of menu items.  The overall format must be as described,
however, because displaying the menu checks for the type 3:no-select*
and for the 3:font* and 3:documentation* modifier keywords.
.end_defmethod

.defmethod tv:menu-execute-mixin :execute-no-side-effects item
Processes 2item*, computing and returning the "value to return",
provided that this can be done without side effects.  If computing the
value to return might possibly have side effects (such as for item
types 3:eval*, 3:funcall*, 3:kbd*, 3:window-op*, 3:menu* and
3:menu-choose*), the value is not computed and 3nil* is returned.

This operation is typically used to find the item in a given item list
that would return a particular value if selected.
.end_defmethod

.defun tv:menu-item-string item &optional item-default-font menu
Returns the string to display for 2item*.  The font to use
is returned as the second value; it defaults to 2item-default-font*
if not specified by the item.  2item-default-font* itself defaults to
the current font of the menu as a window.

2menu* is the menu that 2item* is for; it is used for interpreting
font specifications in 2item* itself.

If you are not interested in the font, you can omit the last two
arguments.
.end_defun

.defflavor tv:window-hacking-menu-mixin
Provides for the 3:window-op* item type by implementing the
3:execute-window-op* operation.  This involves remembering the mouse
position and the window under the mouse at the time the menu is exposed.
.end_defflavor

.subsection Easy Menu Interface

.defun tv:menu-choose item-list &optional label near-mode default-item superior
Pops up a menu and allows the user to make a choice with the mouse.
When the choice is made, the menu disappears and the chosen item is
executed.  The value of that item is returned as the first value of
3tv:menu-choose*, and the item itself is returned as the second
value.

If the user moves the mouse out of the menu and far away, the menu disappears 
and 3tv:menu-choose* returns 3nil*.

2item-list* is a list of items as described above.

2label* is a string to be displayed at the top of the menu, or 3nil* (the default)
to specify the absence of a label.

2near-mode* is where to put the menu.  It defaults to the list 3(:mouse)* and must
be an acceptable argument to 3tv:expose-window-near*.

2default-item* is the item over which the mouse should be positioned
initially.  This allows the user to select that item without moving the mouse.
If 2default-item* is 3nil* or unspecified, the mouse is initially positioned
in the center of the menu.

2superior* is the sheet of which the menu should be an inferior.
The default is 3tv:mouse-sheet*, which is usually a screen.
.end_defun

.need 96
.nopara
Example:
.lisp
(tv:menu-choose '(("Read" :value foo) ("Write" :value bar))
		"Direction")
.end_lisp
.nopara
will return 3foo* or 3bar* (or 3nil* if the user moves the mouse out of the menu).

.defun tv:mouse-y-or-n-p string
Asks the user to answer Yes by clicking on a small window
or No by moving the mouse out of it.  The window is a menu
which displays a single item, 2string*.

The value is 3t* if the user clicks on the menu, or 3nil*
if he moves the mouse out of it.
.end_defun

.subsection Geometry
.setq menu-geometry section-page
.cindex menu geometry
.cindex geometry (or menus)
.cindex filled menus

The way a menu is displayed is described by six parameters that are
collectively called its 2geometry*.  Each of these parameters may be
specified as a constraint, or may be allowed to default based on the
item list and the parameters that are constrained.

There are two styles of arranging the choices in the menu.  They can be
in an array of rows and columns, or they can be "filled", that is, each
line has as many choices as will fit with a reasonable amount of white
space in between.  In columnar format, each line has the same number of
choices: the same as the number of columns.  This is not true in filled
format.  Filled format is specified by giving zero as the number of
columns.

.nopara
The geometry is represented as a list of six elements, one for each
parameter.
.table 2 0 1250
.item columns
The number of columns, or 0 for filled format.

.item rows
The number of rows.

.item inside width
The inside-width of the window, in pixels.

.item inside height
The inside-height of the window, in pixels.

.item maximum width
The maximum width of the window, in pixels.  This parameter is
meaningful only as a constraint, since the way the menu is displayed is
sufficiently described by its actual width.  If the maximum width is
constrained, the system will prefer to choose a tall skinny shape rather
than exceed it.

.item maximum height
The maximum height of the window, in pixels.  This parameter is
meaningful only as a constraint, since the way the menu is displayed is
sufficiently described by its actual height.  If the maximum height is
constrained, the system will prefer to choose a short fat shape rather
than exceed it.
.end_table

For the first four parameters, one must distinguish between the current
value and the imposed constraint.  The constraint values may be 3nil*,
meaning "do not constrain this parameter".  The current values cannot be
3nil*.

The last two parameters exist only as constraints, and may be 3nil*.

The actual display of a menu is based on four parameters: the number of
rows, the number of columns (or whether to use fill mode), the height
and the width.  Some of these may be specified by constraints; others
may be specified on a one-time basis when the menu is displayed;
the rest are chosen based on the ones already known, and on the item
list.

The default geometry constraints are all 3nil*, meaning that the
system can choose the size and shape freely, based on the specified item
list.  The default shape is an upright golden rectangle, using columnar
format with as many columns as fit in the width.  Most small menus will
have only one column.

If both the height and with are specified (either precisely or indirectly)
in such a way that not all the items can fit, the menu will have a scroll bar
and the user will have to scroll to see all the items.

When the item list of a menu is changed, the display of the menu is
recomputed based on the new item list and the geometry.

.nopara
The following init-plist options to a menu will initialize the geometry:

.definitoption tv:menu :geometry list
Sets the complete geometry to 2list*, a list of six elements.
Example:
.lisp
(make-instance 'tv:menu ':geometry (0 nil 300 nil nil 500))
.end_lisp
makes a filled menu that is 300 pixels wide; when its item list is specified
or changed it will become as tall as necessary to display all the items as long
as that does not exceed 500 pixels.  Beyond that point, it will be 500 pixels
high and will require the user to scroll.
.end_definitoption

.definitoption tv:menu :rows n-rows
Sets the number of rows.
.end_definitoption

.definitoption tv:menu :columns n-columns
Sets the number of columns.
.end_definitoption

.definitoption tv:menu :fill-p t-or-nil
Specifies whether to use filled format.
.end_definitoption

.definitoption tv:menu :default-font font
Sets the default font, the font in which items which do not specify a font
are displayed.  If this is not specified, it defaults to
the standard font for the purpose 3:menu* on the screen the menu is on
(see (font-purposes)).
.end_definitoption

.nopara
The following operations manipulate the geometry of a menu:

.defmethod tv:menu :geometry
Returns a list of six things, the menu's geometry.  These are the constraints,
with 3nil* in unspecified positions; contrast 3:current-geometry*.
.end_defmethod

.defmethod tv:menu :current-geometry
Returns a list of six things, which are the geometry corresponding to
the actual current state of the menu.

The first four elements are actually sufficient to describe the current
state.  These are never 3nil*.

The last two elements returned are the constraint values for the maximum
width and height, since there are no current values to return.  These
may be 3nil*.

Contrast this with 3:geometry*.
.end_defmethod

.defmethod tv:menu :set-geometry &optional columns rows inside-width inside-height max-width max-height
Sets the geometry (the constraints) from the arguments.  The menu may
change its shape and redisplay as a result.

Note that this takes six arguments rather than a list of six things as you might expect.
This is because you frequently want to omit most of the arguments.

An explicit argument of 3nil* means to make that aspect of the
geometry unconstrained.  An omitted argument or an argument of 3t*
means to leave that aspect of the geometry the way it is (if
unconstrained, it remains so).
.end_defmethod

.defmethod tv:menu :fill-p
.defmethod1 tv:basic-menu :set-fill-p t-or-nil
Get or set the menu's fill mode, 3t* if it displays in filled format rather than columnar
format.  These are special cases of the 3:geometry/:set-geometry*
operations.
.end_defmethod

.defmethod tv:menu :set-default-font font
Sets the default font, the font in which items that do not specify a font
are displayed.  This recomputes the current display based on the
constraints.
.end_defmethod

.defmethod tv:menu :set-edges left top right bottom &optional option
This operation, in addition to setting the current position and size of
the menu, also makes the specified size be a permanent constraint for
the menu unless 2option* is 3:temporary*.  In that case, the menu is
redisplayed with the specified edges for now, but if it is redisplayed
again for any reason, the permanent constraints (or lack of them)
otherwise specified will re-emerge.
.end_defmethod

.defun tv:menu-compute-geometry draw-p &optional inside-width inside-height
Computes the current display parameters from the constraints and the
item list and default font.  2inside-width* and 2inside-height*
serve as constraints for this time only, overriding any permanent
constraints for those parameters.

If 2draw-p* is non-3nil*, the menu is actually redrawn.

This function is a subroutine of various menu methods, and 3self* must
be the menu.
.end_defun

.defmethod tv:menu :minimum-width
This returns the minimum width for the menu, as required to display its
label.  This is used in deciding how to display the menu.

Other menu flavors can redefine this operation to force
the menu to be wide enough for some purpose.
.end_defmethod

.subsection Ordinary Menus

These are the 2basic* and 2mixin* flavors for the ordinary kinds of
menus.  They cannot be instantiated themselves but are useful to know about.
Other kinds of menus are discussed in later sections.

.defflavor tv:basic-menu
Everything else is built on this.  All the operations documented here as
being defined on 3tv:menu* are really defined by this flavor.
.end_defflavor

.definstvar tv:basic-menu tv:item-list
The item list of the menu.
.end_definstvar

.definstvar tv:basic-menu tv:last-item
The last item actually selected with a mouse click in this menu,
or 3nil* if none has been selected yet.
Used for positioning the mouse when a momentary menu pops up.
.end_definstvar

.definstvar tv:basic-menu tv:current-item
The item which the mouse is pointing at, or 3nil*.
.end_definstvar

.definstvar tv:basic-menu tv:chosen-item
Set each time an item is selected, to that item.
Waiting for an item to be selected is done by setting
this variable to 3nil* and waiting for it to become
non-3nil*.
.end_definstvar

.definstvar tv:basic-menu tv:geometry
The geometry (constraints) of the menu, a list of length 6.
.end_definstvar

.defflavor tv:basic-momentary-menu (3tv:hysteretic-window-mixin* 3tv:basic-menu*)
This is a kind of menu, often referred to as a "pop up" menu, which is
only momentarily on the screen.  A 3:choose* operation on a menu of
this flavor causes it to position itself where the mouse is.  When the
user selects an item in the menu, or alternatively moves the mouse far
away from the menu, the menu disappears and deactivates, the mouse
warps back to where it was when the menu appeared, and the 3:choose*
operation returns the chosen item or 3nil*.
.end_defflavor

.nopara
These are the interesting instantiable menu flavors:

.defflavor tv:menu (3basic-menu* 3borders-mixin* 3top-box-label-mixin* 3basic-scroll-bar* 3minimum-window*)
This is 3tv:basic-menu* with borders and a label on top.  The
default is for there to be no label but you can specify one with the
3:label* init-plist option or the 3:set-label* operation.
.end_defflavor

.defflavor tv:momentary-menu
This is 3tv:basic-momentary-menu* mixed with the right other flavors.
Momentary menus were described at the beginning of this section.
.end_defflavor

.defresource tv:momentary-menu &optional (superior tv:mouse-sheet)
A resource of momentary menus.
.end_defresource

.defflavor tv:temporary-menu (3tv:temporary-window-mixin* 3tv:menu*)
This is a menu that is a temporary window; that is, it saves the bits
of the windows underneath it when it is exposed.  It is not a momentary menu,
and therefore it does not expose or deexpose itself automatically.

It is appropriate to use a temporary menu rather than a momentary menu
when you want to pop a menu up and make several choices from it before
popping it back down, or if you don't want to allow the user the
option of choosing nothing by moving the mouse out of the window.
.end_defflavor

.defflavor tv:momentary-window-hacking-menu (3tv:window-hacking-menu-mixin* 3tv:momentary-menu*)
A momentary menu with the window-hacking mixin.  See
(tv:window-hacking-menu-mixin-flavor).
.end_defflavor

.defresource tv:momentary-menu &optional (superior 3tv:mouse-sheet*)
This is a resource of momentary menus.  3tv:menu-choose* allocates a
window from this resource.
.end_defresource

The following operations are useful on any flavor of menu.  Also listed
are init options which are useful with any flavor of menu.  Operations
and init options that specifically have to do with the shape and
arrangement of the menu are listed in the section on geometry
((menu-geometry)).

.defmethod tv:menu :item-list
.defmethod1 tv:menu :set-item-list item-list
Get or set the list of items (choices).  Setting the item list recomputes the
geometry and redisplays the menu.
.end_defmethod

.definitoption tv:menu :item-list items
The item list can be set when the menu is created.
.end_definitoption

.defmethod tv:menu :choose
Exposes the menu if it is not already exposed, then waits for a selection to be
made with the mouse.  The selection is 3:execute*'d and the resulting value
is returned.  A momentary menu will return 3nil* from 3:choose* if the mouse
is moved far out of it, and in any case will pop down before returning.
.end_defmethod

.defmethod tv:menu :execute item
Given an item that was selected, performs the appropriate side-effects and
returns the appropriate value.  For most kinds of menus, this operation is invoked
automatically as part of the 3:choose* operation, but command menus
(see below) require the user program to invoke 3:execute* explicitly
if it is desired.
.end_defmethod

.defmethod tv:menu :move-near-window window
Exposes the menu above or below 2window*, giving it the same width.
.end_defmethod menu

.defmethod tv:menu :center-around x y
This operation is implemented by all windows, but menus handle it a
little differently.  The window is positioned so that the last item
chosen appears at the specified coordinates (in the superior), if
possible.  If this would cause the menu to stick outside of its
superior, it is offset slightly to keep it inside.  The actual
coordinates of the center of the appropriate item are returned (you
might want to put the mouse there).  Momentary menus use this to put the
menu in such a place that the mouse will be right over the last item
chosen.
.end_defmethod

.defmethod tv:menu :current-item
Gets the item the mouse is currently pointing at (3nil* if none).
In most cases if you are using this operation you are doing something wrong.
.end_defmethod

.defmethod tv:menu :chosen-item
.defmethod1 tv:menu :set-chosen-item item
Get or set the item that has been chosen by the mouse and is being communicated
back to the controlling process.
In most cases if you are using these operations you are doing something wrong.
.end_defmethod

.defmethod tv:menu :last-item
.defmethod1 tv:menu :set-last-item item
Get or set the item that was chosen by the mouse the last time this menu was
used.  When a momentary menu is exposed near the mouse by the 3:choose* operation,
it will put the mouse over this item so that it easy to choose it again.
.end_defmethod

.defmethod tv:menu :column-row-size
Returns two values: the width of a column in bits and the height of a row in bits.
.end_defmethod

.defmethod tv:menu :item-cursorpos item
Returns two values, like 3:read-cursorpos*, giving the coordinates
of the center of the displayed representation of 2item*.  The result
is 3nil* if the item is scrolled off the display.
.end_defmethod

.defmethod tv:menu :item-rectangle item
Returns four values, the coordinates of the rectangle enclosing the displayed
representation of the specified item.  The result is 3nil* if the item
is scrolled off the display.  Note that the returned coordinates are 2inside*
coordinates and that they include a 1-pixel margin around the item.
.end_defmethod

.defmethod tv:menu :menu-draw
Draws the menu's display.  3:menu-draw* is invoked automatically by
the system when required, and should not be used in application
programs.  However, user-defined menu flavors may redefine the operation
or add daemons to it.
.end_defmethod

.defmethod tv:menu :mouse-buttons-on-item buttons-down-mask
This operation is invoked by the mouse process when the mouse is clicked on an
item.  It is completely responsible for whatever should be done in the
mouse process at that time.  Its default definition is to record the
chosen item and process the item type 3:buttons* when that is used.

The instance variable 3tv:current-item* or the 3:current-item*
operation can be used to find out which item the mouse is on.
.end_defmethod

The operations 3:scroll-position*, 3:scroll-to* and
3:scroll-bar-p* are also defined for communication with the scroll
bar.  See (scroll-protocol).

.subsection Command Menus
.setq command-menu section-page

.defflavor tv:command-menu-mixin
The menus described so far are driven by the 3:choose* operation;
that is, the program decides when it is time for the user to choose
something in the menu.  In some applications it should be the user
who decides when to choose something from a menu.  For example,
in Peek, the user can select a new mode with the menu at any time,
but Peek cannot spend all its time waiting for the user to do this.

The command menu is designed for such applications.  When an item in a
command menu is chosen, the menu puts a blip into its input buffer.  The
blip is a list
'cindex blip types
'kindex :menu "blip type"
.lisp
(:menu 2item* 2button-mask* 2menu*)
.end_lisp
which can read as an input character with the 3:any-tyi* operation on
any other window sharing the same input buffer.  2item* is the menu
item that was clicked on, 2button-mask* says which mouse button was
used (as in 3tv:mouse-last-buttons*; see
(tv:mouse-last-buttons-var)), and 2menu* is the menu that was clicked
on, in case you are using more than one.

Usually a command window is part of a team of windows managed by a
single process and sharing a single input buffer.  Menu clicks generate
input that is read in a single stream together with mouse clicks on the
other windows and keyboard input.  For example, Peek and the inspector
both use command menus in this way.  Once the controlling process reads
the blip, it can do 3(funcall 2menu* ':execute 2item*)* if it
wishes the item to be processed in the usual way for menu items.
.end_defflavor

.defflavor tv:command-menu
This is 3tv:command-menu-mixin* mixed with 3tv:menu* to make it instantiable.
.end_defflavor

.defmethod tv:command-menu :io-buffer
.defmethod1 tv:command-menu :set-io-buffer io-buffer
These operations get or set the I/O buffer in which a command-menu sends
stores a blip when an item is selected.
.end_defmethod

.definitoption tv:command-menu :io-buffer io-buffer
The input buffer to be used by a command menu is usually specified when it is created.
.end_definitoption

.definstvar tv:command-menu tv:io-buffer
This is where the input buffer is recorded.
.end_definstvar

.defflavor tv:command-menu-abort-on-deexpose-mixin
When a command menu built on this flavor is deexposed, it automatically
"clicks" on its 3Abort* item.  In other words, the 3:deexpose*
method for this flavor searches the item list for an item whose
displayed representation is 3"ABORT"* (case is not significant).  If
such an item is found, a blip is sent to the input buffer claiming that
that item was clicked on with the Left button.
.end_defflavor

.subsection Dynamic Item List Menus

Dynamic item list menus dynamically recompute the item list at various
times.  Whenever the program makes an explicit request to use the
menu, the menu checks automatically to see whether its item list has
changed.

.defflavor tv:abstract-dynamic-item-list-mixin
This mixin causes a menu to invoke the 3:update-item-list* operation
at various times.  This operation receives no arguments, and its value
is ignored; it should update the item list if appropriate.

This mixin does not 2define* the 3:update-item-list* operation,
however.  Each user of the mixin must define this operation to update
the item list as he desires.
.end_defflavor

.defmetamethod "dynamic item list menus" :update-item-list
Sent by the system, this operation should be defined by the user
to do a 3:set-item-list* if the item list should change.

Note that this operation may be invoked in various processes,
so your definition should use only global variables (and data structure
it can find from the menu itself).
.end_defmethod

.defflavor tv:dynamic-item-list-mixin
Provides for a form which is evaluated to get the menu's item list, kept in
the 3tv:item-list-pointer* instance variable.  The
3:update-item-list* operation is defined to evaluate the form and set
the item list to the form's value.
.end_defflavor

.definstvar tv:dynamic-item-list-mixin tv:item-list-pointer
This is the form evaluated to recompute the current item list.
.end_definstvar

.defmethod tv:dynamic-item-list-mixin :item-list-pointer
.defmethod1 tv:dynamic-item-list-mixin :set-item-list-pointer form
Get or set the form.
.end_defmethod

.definitoption tv:dynamic-item-list-mixin :item-list-pointer form
Initializes the form.
.end_definitoption

.nopara
These are menu flavors that are just combinations of this with other flavors:

.defflavor tv:dynamic-momentary-menu
A momentary menu with the dynamic item-list mixin.
.end_defflavor

.defflavor tv:dynamic-momentary-window-hacking-menu
A momentary menu with both the dynamic item-list mixin and the window-hacking mixin.
.end_defflavor

.defflavor tv:dynamic-temporary-menu
A temporary menu with the dynamic item-list mixin.
.end_defflavor

.defflavor tv:dynamic-temporary-command-menu
A command menu with the temporary and dynamic item-list mixins.
.end_defflavor

.defflavor tv:dynamic-temporary-abort-on-deexpose-command-menu
A command menu with the temporary, abort-on-deexpose, and dynamic item-list
mixins.
.end_defflavor

.defflavor tv:dynamic-multicolumn-mixin
This mixin, to be used with 3tv:abstract-dynamic-item-list-mixin*, makes a
menu of several columns, in which each column's items are independently
dynamically recomputed.  The system menu is such a menu.

The columns are specified by the instance variable
3tv:column-spec-list*.  The value is a list; each element specifies
one column of the menu, and looks like this:
.lisp
(2heading* 2item-list-form* 2options*...)
.end_lisp
2heading* is a string to be displayed (as a 3:no-select* item) at
the top of the column.  2item-list-form* is a form to be evaluated to
produce the list of items for the column.  It should have no side
effects and may be evaluated in any process.  The 2options* are
modifier keywords and values, such as are found in menu items.
These modifiers apply to the column heading only.  The most useful one
is the 3:font* keyword.  For example, the system menu uses this
column spec list:
.lisp
(("Windows" tv:*system-menu-windows-column*
  :font fonts:hl12i)
 ("This window" tv:*system-menu-this-window-column*
  :font fonts:hl12i)
 ("Programs" tv:*system-menu-programs-column*
  :font fonts:hl12i))
.end_lisp
Each column's item list form is a symbol, the name of a special variable.
.end_defflavor

.definstvar tv:dynamic-multicolumn-mixin tv:column-spec-list
This instance variable holds the column spec list.
.end_definstvar

.definitoption tv:dynamic-multicolumn-mixin :column-spec-list
Initializes the column spec list.
.end_definitoption

.defmethod tv:dynamic-multicolumn-mixin :column-spec-list
.defmethod1 tv:dynamic-multicolumn-mixin :set-column-spec-list specs
Get or set the column spec list.
.end_defmethod

.defflavor tv:dynamic-multicolumn-momentary-menu
This is an instantiable, momentary mixture of
3tv:dynamic-multicolumn-mixin*.
.end_defflavor

.defflavor tv:dynamic-multicolumn-momentary-window-hacking-menu
Similar to the previous, but includes 3tv:window-hacking-menu-mixin*.
The system menu is an instance of this flavor.
.end_defflavor

.subsection Multiple Menus

A multiple menu asks the user to select any combination of menu items
rather than a single item.  The menu has a "choice box" (usually named
"Do it") at the bottom in addition to its menu items.  Clicking on a
menu item selects it or unselects it; the selected items are displayed
in inverse video.  Clicking on the "Do it" box specifies the set of
items currently selected.

The 3:choose* operation on a multiple menu returns as its first value
a list of the values of the items selected by the user.

.defun tv:multiple-menu-choose item-list &optional label near-mode highlighted-items superior
Pops up a menu and allows the user to choose any subset of the
available items.  The user finalizes his choice by clicking on the
"Do It" box at the bottom of the menu.  At this time,
3tv:multiple-menu-choose* returns as its first value
a list of the results of executing all the chosen menu items.
The second value of 3tv:multiple-menu-choose* is 3t* in this case.

If the user moves the mouse out of the menu and far away, the menu disappears 
and 3tv:menu-choose* returns 3nil* for both values.  The second value
enables the caller to distinguish between a refusal to choose and choosing
the empty set of items.

2item-list* is a list of menu items as described above.
2highlighted-items* is a list of some of the same items;
these are the items to include, initially, in the set to be chosen.
The user can add items to the set or remove items from the set.

3The elements of 2highlighted-items* must be memq in 2item-list*
for proper functioning.*

2label* is a string to be displayed at the top of the menu, or 3nil* (the default)
to specify the absence of a label.

2near-mode* is where to put the menu.  It defaults to the list 3(:mouse)* and must
be an acceptable argument to 3tv:expose-window-near*.

2superior* is the sheet of which the menu should be an inferior.
The default is 3tv:mouse-sheet*, which is usually a screen.

Example:
.lisp
(tv:multiple-menu-choose '(rice spinach water coke)
			 "Pick some foods" nil '(water))
.end_lisp
might return the list 3(rice spinach water)* if the user clicked on
the entries for 3rice* and 3spinach*, and did not turn off 3water*.

.lisp
(let ((items '(("Rice" :value rice)
	       ("Spinach" :value spinach)
	       ("Water" :value water)
	       ("Coke" :value coke))))
  (tv:multiple-menu-choose items "Pick some foods" '(:mouse)
			   (list (assoc "Water" items))))
.end_lisp
can return the same possible values, but has a prettier display.
.end_defun

.defflavor tv:margin-multiple-menu-mixin
Gives a menu the ability to have multiple items selected in this manner.
.end_defflavor

.defflavor tv:multiple-menu (3tv:margin-multiple-menu-mixin* 3tv:menu* ...)
A menu that behaves as described above.  This is a combination of
3tv:multiple-margin-menu-mixin* with 3tv:menu*.
.end_defflavor

.defflavor tv:momentary-multiple-menu (3tv:margin-multiple-menu-mixin* 3tv:momentary-menu* ...)
A multiple menu that is also momentary.
.end_defflavor

.defresource tv:momentary-multiple-menu &optional (superior tv:mouse-sheet)
A resource of momentary multiple menus, used by 3tv:multiple-menu-choose*.
.end_defresource

.defmethod tv:margin-multiple-menu-mixin :add-item item
Adds 2item* to the item list of the multiple menu, initially
unhighlighted.  All the existing items remain, and remain highlighted if
they already were.
.end_defmethod

.defmethod tv:margin-multiple-menu-mixin :set-item-list item-list
In addition to setting the item list and redisplaying the menu,
all the items start out unhighlighted.
.end_defmethod

.definitoption tv:margin-multiple-menu-mixin :special-choices items
This init option is equivalent to the 3:menu-margin-choices* init
option (which is provided by our component flavor
3tv:menu-margin-choice-mixin*).  It is provided for historical
compatibility.  2items* is a list of menu items that specify the
choice boxes desired and what to do if they are clicked on.
.end_definitoption

.defflavor tv:menu-highlighting-mixin
Provides for some of the menu items to be highlighted with inverse video.
This is typically used with menus of "modes", where the modes currently in
effect are highlighted.  The menu items corresponding to modes will
typically be set up so that when executed, they adjust the highlighting to
reflect the enabling or disabling of a mode.

This flavor is used in 3tv:margin-multiple-menu-mixin*.
.end_defflavor

.definstvar tv:menu-highlighting-mixin tv:highlighted-items
The list of items currently highlighted.
.end_definstvar

.defmethod tv:menu-highlighting-mixin :highlighted-items
.defmethod1 tv:menu-highlighting-mixin :set-highlighted-items list
Get or set the list of highlighted items.
.end_defmethod

.definitoption tv:menu-highlighting-mixin :highlighted-items items
When a menu with the menu-highlighting mixin is created, the list of items to
be initially highlighted may be specified.  The default is 3nil*.
.end_definitoption

.defmethod tv:menu-highlighting-mixin :add-highlighted-item item
.defmethod1 tv:menu-highlighting-mixin :remove-highlighted-item item
Make 2item* be highlighted, or make it stop being highlighted.
.end_defmethod

.defmethod tv:menu-highlighting-mixin :highlighted-values
.defmethod1 tv:menu-highlighting-mixin :set-highlighted-values list
.defmethod1 tv:menu-highlighting-mixin :add-highlighted-value value
.defmethod1 tv:menu-highlighting-mixin :remove-highlighted-value value
These operations are similar to the preceding four, except that instead of referring
to items directly you refer to their values, i.e. the result of executing them.
For instance if your item list is an association list, with elements
3(2string* . 2symbol*)*, these operations use 2symbol*.
This only works for menu items that can be executed without side-effects,
not for item types 3:eval*, 3:funcall*, etc.
.end_defmethod

.defflavor tv:menu-margin-choice-mixin (3tv:margin-choice-mixin*)
This mixin gives a menu the ability to have choice boxes in the
margin.  It is used in multiple menus.

Choice boxes appear in a single line in the bottom margin of the menu.
Each one consists of a name followed by a little square or box.
Clicking on the box activates the choice.

This flavor adapts 3tv:margin-choice-mixin*
(see (tv:margin-choice-mixin-flavor)) for use in menus.
.end_defflavor

.defmethod tv:menu-margin-choice-mixin :menu-margin-choices
.defmethod1 tv:menu-margin-choice-mixin :set-menu-margin-choices items
Get or set the list of choice box items.  The items look and work just
like menu items, and clicking on one has the same effect.  The
difference is only in how and where they display.
.end_defmethod

.definitoption tv:menu-margin-choice-mixin :menu-margin-choices items
Initializes the list of choice box items.
The default value is
.lisp
(("Do It"
  :eval (values (funcall-self ':highlighted-values)
		t)))
.end_lisp
which provides a single choice box and implements the values returned
by 3:tv:multiple-menu-choose*.
.end_definitoption

.defflavor tv:margin-choice-menu
An instantiable menu flavor that also allows margin choices.
.end_defflavor

.defflavor tv:momentary-margin-choice-menu
A instantiable momentary menu flavor that also allows margin choices.
.end_defflavor

.section Multiple Choice Facility
.cindex multiple choice windows
.setq multiple-choice section-page

The 2multiple choice* facility provides a window containing a bunch of
items, one per text line, and several choices about each item.
To see an example of its use, invoke the
editor command 3Meta-X Kill Or Save Buffers*.

For each item, there can be several yes/no choices for the user to make.
There is the same set of choices for each item (though some items may
omit some choices).  For example, in 3Kill Or Save Buffers*, there is
an item (a line) for each buffer, and each line offers choices "Save",
"Kill" and "Unmod".  The choices of the same kind for different items
form a column, with a heading at the top saying what that choice is for.
The leftmost column contains the text naming each item.  The remaining
columns contain small boxes (called 2choice boxes*).  A "no" box has a
blank center, while a "yes" box contains an "X".
'setq choice-box page
Pointing the mouse at a choice box and clicking the left button
turns it on or off.  Each choice can be initialized by the
program to "yes" or "no" as appropriate for a default.

There can be constraints among the choices for an item.  For example,
if you want the choices to be mutually exclusive, you can set up
constraints so that clicking one choice box to "yes" will
automatically set the other choice boxes on the same line to "no".

A multiple choice window may have more lines of choices to offer than
the window has lines.  In this case, the user can scroll, as the
multiple choice window is a kind of text scroll window (see
(text-scroll-windows)).

There are several parameters associated with a multiple-choice window:

The 2item-name* is a string, the column heading for items.  In the editor
example, it is 3"Buffers"*.

The 2item-list* is a list of representations of items.  Each element is a list,
3(2item name choices*)*.  2item* is any arbitrary object, such as an
editor buffer.
2name* is a string which names that object; it will be displayed on the left
on the line of the display devoted to this item.  2choices* is a list of
keywords representing the choices the user can make for this item.  Each
element of 2choices* is either a symbol, 2keyword*, or a list, 3(2keyword default*)*.
If 2default* is present and non-3nil*, the choice is initially "yes";
otherwise it is initially "no".  This is how the editor initializes the
"Save" choice to be "yes" for a modified buffer.

The 2keyword-alist* is a list defining all the choice keywords
allowed.  Each element takes the form 3(2keyword name*)*.
2keyword* is a symbol, the same as in the 2choices* field of an
2item-list* element.  2name* is a string used to name that keyword.
2name* is used as the column heading for the associated column of choice
boxes.

An element of 2keyword-alist* can have up to four additional list elements,
called 2implications*.  These control what happens to other choices for the same
item when this choice is selected by the user.  Each implication can be 3nil*,
meaning no implication, a list of choice keywords, or 3t* meaning all other
choices.  The first implication is 2on-positive*; it specifies what other choices
are also set to "yes" when the user sets this one to "yes".  The second implication
is 2on-negative*; it specifies what other choices are set to "no" when the
user sets this one to "yes".  The third and fourth implications are 2off-positive*
and 2off-negative*; they take effect when the user sets this choice to "no".
The default implications are 3nil* 3t* 3nil* 3nil*, respectively.  In other
words the default is for the choices to be mutually exclusive.

If a 2keyword-alist* element does not contain implications, the
default implications are 3rplacd*'ed into it.

3Kill Or Save Buffers* specifies the implications as
.lisp
((:save "Save" nil (:not-modified) nil nil)
 (:kill "Kill" nil (:not-modified) nil nil)
 (:not-modified "UnMod" nil (:save :kill) nil nil)
 (:compile "QC-FILE" nil nil nil nil))
.end_lisp
so that "Unmod" cannot be chosen together with either "Save" or "Kill".

The 2finishing-choices* are the choices to go in the bottom margin.  When the user
clicks on one of these he is done.  The variable 3tv:default-finishing-choices*
contains a reasonable default for this, providing 3Do It* and 3Abort* choices.

.subsection Functional Interface

This is the easy interface to the multiple choice facility:

.defun tv:multiple-choose item-name item-list keyword-alist &optional near-mode maxlines
Pops up a multiple-choice window and allows the user to make choices with the
mouse.  The dimensions of the window are automatically chosen for the best
presentation of the specified choices.  If there are too many choices,
more than 2maxlines*, scrolling of the window is enabled.

2item-name*, 2item-list*, and 2keyword-alist* are as described above.
2finishing-choices* cannot be specified and is always the default.

When the user clicks on one of the two finishing choices in the bottom margin
(3Do It* and 3Abort*) the window disappears and 3tv:multiple-choose* returns.
If the user finishes by choosing 3Abort* the returned value is 3nil*,
and the second returned value is 3:abort*.
If the user chooses 3Do It*, the returned value is a list with one element
for each item.  Each element is a list whose car is the 2item* (that
arbitrary object which the user passed in in the 2item-list* argument)
and whose cdr is a list of the keywords for the "yes" choices selected for that item.

2near-mode* tells the window where to pop up.  It is a suitable argument
for 3tv:expose-window-near*.  The default is the list 3(:mouse)*.
2maxlines*, which defaults to twenty, is the
maximum number of choices allowed before scrolling is used.
.end_defun

Here is an example:
.lisp
(tv:multiple-choose "Word"
   '((:eat "Eat" (:add :make-permanent))
     (:drink "Drink" (:forget :make-permanent)))
   '((:add "Add" nil nil nil (:make-permanent))
     (:forget "Forget" nil (:make-permanent) nil nil)
     (:make-permanent "Make Permanent" (:add) (:forget) nil nil)))
.end_lisp
offers the possibilities of 3:add* or 3:make-permanent* for 3:eat*
and the possibilities of 3:forget* or 3:make-permanent* for 3:drink*.
Presumably this would be done because 3:drink* has already been "added"
and 3:eat* has not been.

The implications say that making permanent is incompatible with forgetting
when forgetting is possible, and requires adding when adding is possible.

The value returned might be
.lisp
((:eat :add :make-permanent)
 (:drink))
.end_lisp

In this example, the items are keywords (symbols), but that is not significant.
The system never looks inside them; it just compares them with 3eq* and
puts them in the returned value.

.subsection Flavors and Operations

These are the grubby details:

.defflavor tv:basic-multiple-choice (3tv:displayed-items-text-scroll-window* 3tv:margin-choice-mixin* ...)
This is the 2basic* flavor that makes a window implement the multiple-choice facility.
Like most basic mixins, it is not itself instantiable but it does commit any window
that incorporates it to being a multiple-choice rather than any different sort of window.
.end_defflavor

.definstvar tv:basic-multiple-choice tv:item-name
The window's item name.
.end_definstvar

.definstvar tv:basic-multiple-choice tv:choice-types
The window's keyword alist.
.end_definstvar

.defflavor tv:multiple-choice (3tv:basic-multiple-choice* 3tv:top-box-label-mixin* 3tv:window*)
This is a reasonable window with the multiple-choice facility in it.  It has borders
and a label area on top which is used for the column headings.
.end_defflavor

.defflavor tv:temporary-multiple-choice-window (3tv:temporary-window-mixin* 3tv:multiple-choice*)
This is a multiple-choice window which is equipped to pop up temporarily.
.end_defflavor

.defresource tv:temporary-multiple-choice-window &optional (superior tv:mouse-sheet)
This is a resource of temporary multiple-choice windows, used by the 3tv:multiple-choose*
function.
.end_defresource

.nopara
The following operations are provided by multiple choice windows.

.definitoption tv:basic-multiple-choice :item-list item-list
Initializes the window's item list to 2item-list*.
.end_definitoption

.defmethod tv:multiple-choice :setup item-name keyword-alist finishing-choices item-list &optional maxlines
This operation sets up all the various parameters of the window.
Usually it is used while the window is deexposed.  The window decides what size
it should be and whether all the items will fit or scrolling is required, then
draws the display into its bit-array.  Thus when the window is exposed the display
will appear instantaneously.

2maxlines* is the maximum number of lines the window may have; if there are more
items than this only some of them will be displayed and scrolling will be enabled.
2maxlines* defaults to 320.*

The 2finishing-choices* are a list of choices for
3tv:margin-choice-mixin* (see (tv:margin-choice-mixin-flavor)).  When
one of these finishing choices is clicked on, it should set the instance
variable 3tv:choice-value* of 3self* to either a symbol (for an
abnormal exit) or a list for the 3:choose* operation to return.
.end_defmethod

.definstvar tv:basic-multiple-choice tv:choice-value
When the mouse process sets this non-3nil*, the 3:choose* operation returns.
.end_definstvar

.defmethod tv:multiple-choice :choose &optional near-mode
Moves the window to the place specified by 2near-mode*, which defaults
to the list 3(:mouse)*, and exposes it.  Then waits for the user to make a
finishing choice and returns the window to its original activate/expose
status before the 3:choose*.  This operation returns the same value as
the function 3tv:multiple-choose*. 
.end_defmethod

.section Choose-Variable-Values Facility
.cindex choose-variable-values windows
.setq choose-variable-values section-page

This facility presents the user with a display of a bunch of Lisp variables
and their values.  The user may change the value of some of the variables.
When the values are to his liking he may indicate that he is done.

The choose-variable-values window is a kind of text scroll window, so
each line of the display corresponds to one variable.  The name of the variable,
a colon, and the value of the variable are displayed.  Pointing the mouse at the
value causes a box to appear around it.  Clicking the left mouse button at that point allows
the value to be changed.

For an example of a choose-variable-values window, try the 3Frame* option
of the 3Split Screen* item in the system menu.  ZMail profile mode is
also a good example.

.subsection Specifying the Variables
.setq c-v-v-specs section-page

When you use a choose-variable-values window, you must specify
one or more variables with a list of specifiers.  You pass the
list as an argument to 3tv:choose-variable-values*.

Each variable has a 2type* which controls what values it may take
on, the way the value is displayed and the way the user enters a new
value.  The type mechanism is extensible and is described in detail
later.  The types fall into two categories, those with a small number
of legal values and those with a large or infinite number of legal
values.  The first kind of type displays all the choices, with the one
which is the current value of the variable in bold-face.  Pointing at
a choice and clicking the mouse sets the variable to that value.
Those types with a large number of legal values display the current
value.  Pointing at the value and clicking the mouse allows a new
value to be entered from the keyboard.  Rubbing out more characters
than typed in restores the original value instead of changing it.

The variables themselves can be either symbols, which are effectively
examined and set as special variables in the calling program's
process, or locatives, whose contents are examined and set.  The
syntax for input and output is controlled by the binding of 3base*,
3ibase*, 3*nopoint*, 3prinlevel*, 3prinlength*, 3package*,
and 3readtable* as usual.

.nopara
Each line of the display is specified by an 2item*, which can be one of the
following:
.table 3

.item 1a string*
The string is simply displayed.  This is useful for putting headings and
blank separating lines into the display.

.item 1a symbol*
The symbol is a variable whose type is 3:sexp*; that is, its value may
be any Lisp object.  The name of the variable on the display is simply
its print-name, and the value is stored as the value of the symbol.

.item 1a list* (2variable name type args...*)
This is the general form.  2variable* is the variable whose value is
being chosen.  It is either a symbol or a locative.  If 2name* is
supplied it can be a string, which is displayed as the name of the
variable, or it can be 3nil*, meaning that this line should have no
variable name, but only a value.  2name* is optional; if it is omitted
it defaults to the print-name of 2variable*, or to 3nil* if
2variable* is a locative.

2type* is an optional keyword giving
the type of variable; if omitted it defaults to 3:sexp*.  2args* are possible
additional specifications dependent on 2type*.

It is possible to omit 2name* and supply 2type* since one is always
a string or 3nil* and the other is always a non-3nil* symbol.
.end_table

For clarification of this, refer to the examples on (choose-variable-values-examples).

.subsection Predefined Variable Types

The following are the types of variables supported by default, along with any
2args* that may be put in the item after the 2type* keyword:

.table 3
.c If you think this is a bad name, think of a better one.
.xitem :sexp "choose variable values"
.xitem1 :any "choose variable values"
The value is any Lisp expression (sometimes called an S-expression),
printed with 3prin1*, read with 3read*.

.xitem :princ "choose variable values"
Same as 3:sexp* except that the value is printed with 3princ* rather than 3prin1*.

.xitem :string "choose variable values"
The value is a string, printed with 3princ*, read with 3readline*.

.xitem :number "choose variable values"
The value is any type of number.  It is printed with 3prin1*
and read with 3read*, but only a number is accepted as input.

.xitem :number-or-nil "choose variable values"
The value may be either a number or 3nil*.

.xitem :date "choose variable values"
The value is a universal date-time.  It is printed with 3time:print-universal-time*
and read with 3readline-trim* and 3time:parse-universal-time*.

.xitem :date-or-never "choose variable values"
The value is either a universal date-time or 3nil*.  3nil* is
printed as "never", and a number is printed using
3time:print-universal-time*.  Input is read with 3readline-trim*; if the
string is not "never" it is passed to 3time:parse-universal-time*.

.xitem :interval-or-never "choose variable values"
The value is either 3nil* or a number of seconds.  It is printed with
3time:print-interval-or-never* and new values are read using
3time:read-interval-or-never*.

.xitem :character "choose variable values"
The value is a character code.  It is printed as the character
name (using the 3~:@C* 3format* operator), and is read as a single keystroke.

.xitem :character-or-nil "choose variable values"
Like 3:character* but 3nil* is also allowed as the value.  3nil* displays
as "none" and can be input via the 3Clear Input* key.

.xitem :string-list "choose variable values"
The value is a list of strings, whose printed representation for input and output
consists of the strings separated by commas and spaces.

.xitem :pathname "choose variable values"
.item1 1a list* (:pathname 2defaults*)
The value is a pathname (see chapter 22 of the Lisp Machine manual).  It is
printed with 3princ* and read with 3readline*, 3fs:parse-pathname*,
and 3fs:merge-pathname-defaults*.  If 2defaults* is provided, it is
a pathname or a defaults-alist to pass to
3fs:merge-pathname-defaults*.  It can also be a symbol whose value
should be used.  If it is the same variable this item is setting,
then each typed-in value is merged with the previous setting.

.xitem :pathname-or-nil "choose variable values"
Like 3:pathname* but 3nil* is also allowed as a value.  It is read and
printed as a blank line.

.xitem :pathname-list "choose variable values"
The value is a list of pathnames.  In the printed representation they
are separated by commas.

'kindex :choose "choose variable values"
.item :choose 2values-list* 2print-function*
The value of the variable must be one of the elements of the list 2values-list*.
Comparison is by 3equal* rather than 3eq*.  All the choices are displayed, with
the current value in boldface.  A new value is input by pointing to it with the mouse
and clicking.  2print-function* is the function to print a value; it is optional
and defaults to 3princ*.

'kindex :assoc "choose variable values"
.item :assoc 2values-list* 2print-function*
Like 3:choose* but car of each element of 2values-list* is what to display,
while cdr is the value that goes in the variable.

'kindex :menu-alist "choose variable values"
.item :menu-alist 2item-list*
Like 3:choose*, but instead of a list of values there is 2item-list*,
which is a list of menu items (see (menu)).  The usual menu mechanisms for
specifying the string to display, the value to return, and the mouse
documentation work with this.

.xitem :boolean "choose variable values"
The value of the variable is either 3t* or 3nil*.  The choices are
displayed as 3yes* and 3no*.

'kindex :documentation "choose variable values"
.item :documentation 2doc* 2type* 2args...*
This is not really a variable type, but goes in the place where a type
would normally be expected.  The real type is 2type*; it and its
2args* are optional as usual.  2doc* is a string which is displayed
in the mouse documentation line when the mouse is pointing at this item.
The default if no documentation is supplied in this way depends on the
type, and generally is something like "Click left to input a new value from
the keyboard."
.end_table

.subsection Functional Interface

.defun tv:choose-variable-values variables &rest options
This is the easy-to-use function interface to the choose-variable-values facility.
It pops up a window displaying the values of the specified variables and
permits the user to alter them.  One or more choice boxes (as in the multiple-choice
facility) appear in the bottom margin of the window.  When the user clicks on
the 2Exit* choice box the window disappears and this function returns.
The value returned is not meaningful; the result is expressed in the values of
the variables.

The system chooses the dimensions of the window, and enables scrolling
if there are too many variables to fit in the chosen height.

2variables* is a list whose elements can be special variables or the 
more general items described above.  See the examples below.

2options* is the usual list of alternating option keywords and argument values.
The following option keywords are allowed:
.table 3
.kitem :label
The argument is a string that is the label to be displayed at the top
of the window.  The default is 3"Choose Variable Values"*.

.kitem :function
The function to be called if the user changes the value of a variable.
The default is 3nil* (no function).  The use of this function is
described below ((c-v-v-function)).

.kitem :near-mode
Where to position the window.  This is a suitable argument for 3tv:expose-window-near*.
The default is the list 3(:mouse)*.

.kitem :width
Specifies how wide to make the window.  This can be a number of characters,
or a string (it is made just wide enough to display that string).  The default
is to make it wide enough to display the current values of all the variables,
provided that isn't too wide to fit in the superior.

.kitem :extra-width
When 3:width* is not specified, this specifies the amount of extra space to
leave after the current value of each variable of the kind that displays its
current value (rather than a menu of all possible values).  This extra space
allows for changing the value to something bigger.  The extra space is specified
as either a number of characters or a character string.  The default is ten
characters.  If 3:width* is specified, then 3:extra-width* is ignored.

.kitem :margin-choices
The argument is a list of specifications for choice boxes to appear in the bottom margin.
Each element can be a string, which is the label for the box which means "done",
or a cons of a label string and a form to be evaluated if that choice box is clicked upon.
Since this form is evaluated in the user process it can do such things as alter
the values of variables or 3*throw* out.  
The default for 3:margin-choices* is 3("Exit")*.

.kitem :superior
The argument is the window to which the pop-up choose-variable-values window should
be inferior.  The default is the value of 3tv:mouse-sheet*, or the superior of
2w* if 2near-mode* is 3(:window 2w*)*.

.kitem :reverse-video-p
The argument is used to control whether the window displays white-on-black or
black-on-white.  It is used as the argument of the 3:set-reverse-video-p* operation.
.end_table
.end_defun

.setq c-v-v-function page
A choose-variable-values window optionally may have an 2associated
function*, which is called whenever the user commands the window to
change the value of one of the variables.

This function can implement constraints among the variables.  It is
called with arguments 2window*, 2variable*, 2old-value*, and
2new-value*.  The function should return 3nil* if just the
original variable needs to be redisplayed, or 3t* if no redisplay is
required; in this case it would usually 3setq* several of the
variables, then perform a 3:refresh* operation on the window.

.need 2000
.setq choose-variable-values-examples page
Here are some examples of how to call 3tv:choose-variable-values*.  The simplest
sort of thing you can do is:
.lisp
(tv:choose-variable-values '(base ibase *nopoint)
			   ':label "Number format parameters")
.end_lisp
which displays the three variables' names and values and lets the user change them.
The same example can be done with nicer formatting with:
.lisp
(tv:choose-variable-values
	'((base "Output Base" :number)
	  (ibase "Input Base" :number)
	  (*nopoint "Decimal Point"
		    :assoc (("Yes" . nil)
			    ("No" . t))))
	':label "Number format parameters")
.end_lisp
The entry for 3*nopoint* would have been simply
.lisp
	 (*nopoint "No Decimal Point" :boolean)
.end_lisp
except that we wanted to reverse the sense of 3t* and 3nil*.
We might even have used
.lisp
	 (*nopoint :boolean)
.end_lisp
if we wanted to use the name of the variable as the label rather than
spelling it out.

For a hokier example, consider a grocery store.  Suppose we have
variables 3*cuts-of-beef**, 3*cuts-of-pork**, 3*cuts-of-lamb**,
and 3*lettuce-types**, which contain lists of
strings indicating what is available, 3*squash-type**, which indicates
whether we stock summer squash or winter squash, and 3*milk-price**, which
contains a floating-point number that is the current price of a gallon
of milk.  Then the following expression would display the inventory and
allow it to be modified, using several different kinds of items:
.lisp
(tv:choose-variable-values
	'("Meat Department"
	  (*cuts-of-beef* "Beef" :string-list)
	  (*cuts-of-pork* "Pork" :string-list)
	  (*cuts-of-lamb* "Lamb" :string-list)
	  ""
	  "Produce"
	  (*lettuce-types* "Lettuce" :string-list)
	  (*squash-type* "Squash" :choose ("Summer" "Winter"))
	  ""
	  "Dairy"
	  (*milk-price* "Milk" 
		:documentation
		    "Click left to raise the price of milk"
		:number)))
.end_lisp
Note the use of strings to provide labels for the sections, and null
strings to separate the sections with blank lines.

.subsection Defining Your Own Variable Type

.defmethod tv:basic-choose-variable-values :decode-variable-type kwd-and-args
The system uses this operation on a choose-variable-values window when
it needs to understand an item.  2kwd-and-args* is a list whose car
is the item's type keyword and whose remaining elements, if
any, are
the arguments to that keyword.  Six values are returned; these values
are described below.  The default method for 3:decode-variable-type*
looks for two properties on the keyword's property list:
.table 3
.item tv:choose-variable-values-keyword
The value of this property is a list of the six values described below.
Unnecessary values of 3nil* may be omitted at the end.

.item tv:choose-variable-values-keyword-function
The value of this property is a function that is called with one
argument, 2kwd-and-args*.  The function must return the six values.
.end_table

You may add a new variable type to the standard set by putting one of
the above properties on the keyword.
You may define your own flavor of choose-variable-values window and give
it a 3:decode-variable-type* method to make it not use the standard
variable types.  This method must take care of implementing the
3:documentation* keyword, which can appear in an item where a variable type
would normally appear.
.end_defmethod

The six magic values are:
.table 2

.item print-function
A function of two arguments, object and stream, to be used to print the value.
3prin1* is acceptable.

.item read-function
A function of one argument, the stream, to be used to read a new value.
3read* is acceptable.
If 3nil* is specified, there is no read-function and instead new values
are specified by pointing at one choice from a list.  If the 2read-function*
is a symbol, it is called inside a rubout-handler, and over-rubout will automatically
leave the variable with its original value.  If 2read-function* is a list, its
3car* is the function, and it will be called directly rather than inside a rubout-handler.

.item choices
A list of the choices to be printed, or 3nil* if just the current value is to be printed.
The choices are printed using the 2print-function*, just as the
current value is.

.item print-translate
If there are choices, and this function is supplied non-3nil*, it is
given an element of the choice list and must return the value to be
printed using the 2print-function*.

.item value-translate
If there are choices, and this function is supplied non-3nil*, it is
given an element of the choice list and must return the value to be stored in
the variable.

.item documentation
A string to display in the mouse documentation line when the mouse is
pointing at this item.  This string should tell the user that clicking
the mouse will change the value of this variable and give any special
information (e.g. that the value must be a number).

Alternatively, this can be a symbol that is the name of a function.  It will
be called with one argument, which is the current element of 2choices* or
the current value of the variable if 2choices* is 3nil*.  It should return
a documentation string or 3nil* if the default documentation is desired.  This
can be useful when you want to document the meaning of a particular choice,
rather than simply saying that clicking the mouse on this choice will select it.
Note that the function should return a constant string, rather than building
one with 3format* or other string operations, because it will be called
over and over as long as the mouse is pointing at an item of this type.
The function is called by the who-line updating in the scheduler, not in the user process.
.end_table

.lisp
.exdent 96 For example, 3:boolean* is defined thus:
(defprop :boolean 
         (choose-variable-values-boolean-print nil (t nil))
	 choose-variable-values-keyword)
(defun choose-variable-values-boolean-print (value stream)
  (funcall stream ':string-out (if value "Yes" "No")))
.end_lisp

The type 3:any* is defined with
.lisp
(defprop :any (prin1 read) tv:choose-variable-values-keyword)
.end_lisp

.subsection Making Your Own Window

The function 3tv:choose-variable-values* may not be adequate
if you wish to keep the window permanently exposed or if you wish
to alter its behavior.  Then you must create a window yourself.
Here are the pertinent flavors.

.defflavor tv:basic-choose-variable-values (3tv:mouse-sensitive-text-scroll-window-without-click*)
This is the 2basic* flavor which makes a window implement the choose-variable-values
facility.  It is not instantiable.
.end_defflavor

.defflavor tv:choose-variable-values-window (3tv:basic-choose-variable-values* 3tv:window* ...)
This is a choose-variable-values window with a reasonable set of
features, including borders, a label at the top, stream I/O, the
ability to be scrolled if there are too many variables to fit in the
window, and the ability to have choice boxes in the bottom margin.
.end_defflavor

.defflavor tv:choose-variable-values-pane (3tv:choose-variable-values-window*)
A 3tv:choose-variable-values-window* designed to be a pane of a constraint frame.
It redefines the 3:adjustable-size-p* operation to return 3nil* always,
on the assumption that the window's size has been specified by the frame
and cannot be changed except by the frame.
.end_defflavor

.defflavor tv:temporary-choose-variable-values-window (3tv:choose-variable-values-window* 3tv:temporary-window-mixin*)
A 3tv:choose-variable-values-window* that is equipped to pop up temporarily.
.end_defflavor

.defresource tv:temporary-choose-variable-values-window &optional (superior tv:mouse-sheet)
This is a resource of such windows, from which
3tv:choose-variable-values* gets a window to use.
.end_defresource

There are two main styles of use: to create a window giving all of
the parameters in the init-plist, or to create a window without
specifying the parameters, and then use the 3:setup* operation (see
below) to set the parameters before using the window.
But in any case, you must specify the list of variable-specifiers
(see (c-v-v-specs)) and the stack group to evaluate variables in
before you can use the window.

.nopara
The following init options are available:

.definitoption tv:basic-choose-variable-values :variables specifier-list
Initializes the list of variable-specifiers, telling the window
which variables to display and how to read and print the values.
.end_definitoption

.definitoption tv:basic-choose-variable-values :function fcn
Initializes the 2associated function* (see (c-v-v-function)), the
function called when the window changes the value of one of the
variables it displays.  The default is 3nil* (no function).
.end_definitoption

.definstvar tv:basic-choose-variable-values tv:function
The window's associated function.
.end_definstvar

.definitoption tv:basic-choose-variable-values :stack-group sg
The stack group in which the variables whose values are to be chosen
are bound.  The window needs to know this so that it can get the values
while running in another process, for instance the mouse process,
in order to update the window display when it is refreshed or scrolled.
If you do not specify the stack group at this time, you must specify it
with the 3:setup* operation, before you can use the window.
.end_definitoption

.definstvar tv:basic-choose-variable-values tv:stack-group
The stack group in which variables' values should be evaluated.
.end_definstvar

.definitoption tv:basic-choose-variable-values :name-font font
The font in which names of variables are displayed.
The default is the system default font.
.end_definitoption

.definitoption tv:basic-choose-variable-values :value-font font
The font in which values of variables are displayed.
The default is the system default font.
.end_definitoption

.definitoption tv:basic-choose-variable-values :string-font font
The font in which items that are just strings (typically heading lines)
are displayed.
The default is the system default font.
.end_definitoption

.definitoption tv:basic-choose-variable-values :unselected-choice-font font
The font in which choices for a value, other than the current value,
are displayed.
The default is a small distinctive font.
.end_definitoption

.definitoption tv:basic-choose-variable-values :selected-choice-font font
The font in which the current value of a variable is displayed, when
there is a finite set of choices.  This should be a bold-face version
of the preceding font.  The default is the bold-face version of the
default unselected-choice font.
.end_definitoption

.definitoption tv:choose-variable-values-window :margin-choices choice-list
The default is a single choice box, labeled "Done".
See (margin-choice) for the details of what you can put here.
Note that specifying 3nil* for this option will suppress the margin-choices entirely.
.end_definitoption

If no dimensions are specified in the init-plist, the width and height will
be automatically chosen according to the other init-plist parameters.  The
height is dictated by the number of variables to be displayed.
Specifying a height in the init-plist, using any of the standard dimension-specifying
init-plist options, overrides the automatic choice of height.

.nopara
Choose-variable-values windows provide these operations:

.defmethod tv:choose-variable-values-window :setup items label function margin-choices
Changes the list of items (variables), the window label, the constraint function,
and the choices in the bottom margin, and sets up the display.  Also remembers
the current stack-group as the stack-group in which the variables are bound.
If the window is not exposed (more generally, if the
3:adjustable-size-p* operation on the window returns non-3nil*),
this reshapes the window to a good size based on the specified items.
.end_defmethod

.defmethod tv:choose-variable-values-window :set-variables item-list &optional dont-set-height
Sets the list of variable-specifiers which controls the variables
displayed in the window, then redisplays the window.

Unless
2dont-set-height* is supplied non-3nil*, the height of the window
will be adjusted according to the number of lines required.  If more
than 25. lines would be required, 25. lines will be used and scrolling
will be enabled.  The 3:setup* operation uses 3:set-variables* to do part of its work.
.end_defmethod

.defmethod tv:choose-variable-values-window :adjustable-size-p
If this returns non-3nil*, 3:setup* will reshape the window.
By default, this operation returns non-3nil* when the window is
deexposed.
.end_defmethod

.defmethod tv:choose-variable-values-window :appropriate-width &optional extra-space
Returns the inside-width appropriate for this window to accommodate the current
set of variables and their current values.  Use this operation after a 3:setup*
and before a 3:expose*, and use the result to do a 3:set-inside-size*.
The returned width will not be larger than the maximum that will fit inside the
superior.

If 2extra-space* is supplied, it specifies the amount of extra space to
leave after the current value of each variable that displays its
current value (rather than a menu of all possible values).  This extra space
allows for changing the value to something bigger.  The extra space is specified
as either a number of characters or a character string.  The default is to leave
no extra space.
.end_defmethod

.defmethod tv:choose-variable-values-window :redisplay-variable variable
Redisplays just the value of that variable.
.end_defmethod

In the simplest mode of operation, you call the 3tv:choose-variable-values*
function, which takes care of creating the window and all necessary communication
with it.  When you make your own choose-variable-values window, you need to
handle the communication yourself, using the information given below.  An
example of a situation in which this is necessary is when you have a frame, some
panes of which are choose-variable-values windows.

A choose-variable-values window handles mouse clicks by putting blips
(lists) in its input buffer.  These blips are generated by the mouse
process and are supposed to be read in the controlling process.  There
are two types of blip, both used for specific purposes, and your
program must be able to take the appropriate actions when it reads
them.  The easy way for you to do this is to call the function
3tv:choose-variable-values-process-message*, which is provided just
for this purpose.

.definitoption tv:choose-variable-values-window :io-buffer io-buffer
The I/O buffer to be used for blips and for ordinary input from the window.
.end_definitoption

'cindex blip types
.nopara
The following forms of list are inserted as blips into the input buffer:
.table
'kindex :variable-choice "blip type"
.item (:variable-choice 2window* 2item* 2value* 2line-no* 2button*)
Indicates that the user clicked on the value of a variable, expressing the desire
to change it.
The controlling process should read keyboard input as necessary and set
the variable.

'kindex :choice-box "blip type"
.item (:choice-box 2window* 2box*)
Indicates that the user clicked on one of the choice boxes in the bottom margin.
The controlling process may wish to deexpose the window if the box
was the "Done" box.
.end_table

.defun tv:choose-variable-values-process-message window blip
This function implements the proper response to the above blips.  It should be
called in the process and stack-group in which the variables being chosen are bound.  2window* should be the choose-variable-values window
and 2blip* should be the object read as input.

This function returns 3nil* except in the case where
2blip* indicates a click on a "Done" choice box.

If 2blip* says that the user clicked on a variable,
this function reads user input from the window as necessary and sets
the variable.

If 2blip* is a 3:choice-box* blip, the action depends
on the 2box* in it.  If the sixth element of 2box* is
3nil*, which is normally the case for the "Done" box,
this function returns 3t*.  Otherwise, the sixth element
of 2box* is evaluated, but this function returns 3nil*.

If 2blip* is actually a character rather than a blip,
it is ignored unless it is a 3Clear-screen*, in which
case the choose-variable-values window is refreshed.
Therefore, it is reasonable to use this function with a loop
like this:
.lisp
(do ()
    ((tv:choose-variable-values-process-message
       c-v-v-window
       (progn
	 (process-wait "Choose" c-v-v-window ':listen)
	 (send c-v-v-window ':any-tyi)))))
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.subsection User Option Facility

There is a facility, based on the choose-variable-values facility, for keeping track
of options to a program of the sort that a user would specify once and keep in his
init file.  Special forms are provided for defining options, and there are functions
for putting all the options into a choose-values window so that the user can alter
them, for writing the current state of the options into an init file, and for resetting
all the options to their default initial values.

.defspec define-user-option-alist name constructor documentation
Defines 2name* a special variable whose value is
a "user option alist", something which may be used by the other
functions below.  This alist will keep track of all of the option variables for
a particular program.

The simplest usage is
3(define-user-option-alist 2name*)*, which just defines 2name*.

3(define-user-option-alist 2name* 2constructor*)* specifies in addition the name
of a constructor macro to be defined, which provides a slightly different way of defining an
option variable from 3defvar-user-option*.  The form
3(2constructor* 2option* 2default* 2name* 2type* 2args*...)* will define
an option in this user-option-alist.  The arguments are the same as the
similarly-named arguments to 3defvar-user-option*.

A third argument may be used to specify a documentation string for the
variable 2name*.  To specify a documentation string and no constructor,
give 3nil* for the constructor.
.end_defspec

.defspec defvar-user-option
Defines an option and adds it to a user option list.
.lisp
(defvar-user-option 2option* 2default* 2documentation*
  2alist* 2name* 2type* 2args*...)
.end_lisp
defines the special variable 2option*
to be an option in the 2alist*, which must have been previously
defined with 3define-user-option-alist*.  The variable is declared and initialized
via 3(defvar 2option default documentation*)*.  The value of the form 2default*
is remembered so that the variable can be reset back to it later.  

2type* is the type of the variable for purposes of the choose-variable-values facility.
It is optional and defaults to 3:sexp*.  2args*, which are evaluated (at the time
the definition is done), are the arguments for the type keyword used.

2name* is the name of the variable to be displayed in the
choose-variable-values window.  If it is omitted or 3nil*, the default
is 3(string-capitalize-words (get-pname 2option*))*; except that
when the first and last characters of the print-name are asterisks, they
are removed.  E.g. the default name for 3sowq:*sunny-side-up** would
be 3"Sunny Side Up"*.

.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(defvar-user-option preferred-radix 8 
  "Radix to use for files that don't specify one."
  my-program-option-alist "Preferred radix"
  :assoc '(("8" 8) ("10" 10.)))
.end_lisp
.end_defspec

.defspec defvar-site-user-option
This is like 3defvar-user-option*, except that instead of an initial
value a site option keyword is specified.  Instead of a default value,
you specify the name of a site option (a keyword).  The actual default
value is the value of that site option in the current
site table.  Loading a new site table resets the option.
.end_defspec

.defspec defvar-site-alist-user-option
Defines a user option whose possible values are controlled by
site options.
.lisp
(defvar-site-alist-user-option 2option* 2default* 2documentation*
  2alist* 2name* 2menu-alist*)
.end_lisp
defines 2option* as a user option on 2alist*, like
2defvar-site-user-option*.  The 2type* for 3tv:choose-variable-values* is
always 3:menu-alist*, and the list of menu items to be used is
determined from the site table according to 2menu-alist*.

2menu-alist* is a symbol whose value is a menu alist, a list of menu
items.  These items are the alternatives offered to the user, as in the
3:menu-alist* type of variable.  However, each menu item specifies a
site option keyword, and that alternative is available to the user only
if that site option currently has a non-3nil* value.

The menu item can specify the controlling site keyword using the
modifier keyword 3:site-keyword*, as in 
.lisp
("Foo" :value :foo :site-keyword :foo-present)
.end_lisp
If this is not done, the menu item's value-to-return is also the site
keyword.

2default* is the name of a site keyword whose value specifies the
default.  This site option's value is matched against each menu item,
comparing it against the value of the modifier keyword
3:default-site-keyword*, or, if that is not present, against the menu
item's site keyword name.  The first match is the default alternative.
Thus 3"Foo"* will be the default alternative if the 2default*
site option's value is 3:foo-present*.

If 2default* is 3nil*, then the first available menu alist item is
also the default.
.end_defspec

.defun choose-user-options alist &rest options
Displays the values of the option variables in 2alist* to the user and
allows them to be altered.  The 2options* are passed along to
3tv:choose-variable-values*.  Note that 2alist* is an actual alist,
not a symbol whose value is an alist.
.end_defun

.defun reset-user-options alist
Each of the option variables in 2alist* is reset to its default initial value.
.end_defun

.defmac tv:restrict-user-option option restriction-type site-options...
Specifies that the user option variable 2option* is significant only
if the site tables for your site do (or, if they do not) contain one
of the specified 2site-options*.

'kindex :if tv:restrict-user-option
'kindex :unless tv:restrict-user-option
2restriction-type* is either 3:if* or 3:unless*.  If it is
3:if*, the option should be mentioned in the choose-variable-values
window only if one of the specified site options is present in the
currently loaded site table.  3:unless* means that the option should
be offered only if none of the specified site options is loaded.

Each option may have an 3:if* restriction and an 3:unless*
restriction.

Elimination of options from an alist according to their restrictions
is done by 3tv:prune-user-option-alist*, calling which is up to you.

2restriction-type* may also be 3:never*.  Then the option is never
offered to the user to change, but it will still be reset and
written with the other options.
.end_defmac

.defun tv:prune-user-option-alist alist
Returns an alist containing only some of the elements of 2alist*,
lacking those that are suppressed by restrictions, or that offer
only a single alternative.  (The latter is likely to happen with
a site-menu-alist user option if a given site allows only one of
the possible alternatives.)
.end_defun

.defun write-user-options alist stream
For each option variable in 2alist* whose current value is not 3equal* to
its default initial value, a form is printed to 2stream* that will set the
variable to its current value.  The form uses 3login-setq* so it is appropriate
for putting into an init file.
.end_defun

.section Mouse-Sensitive Type Out

The mouse-sensitive items facility is a feature somewhat related to the choice
facilities described above.  It is similar in its appearance to the
user, but quite different in the way it is interfaced to by a program.
Mixing 3tv:basic-mouse-sensitive-items* into a window flavor equips
the window with mouse-handling according to the  paradigm described in
this section.  Mouse-sensitive items are something you use when defining
your own window, rather than a complete, stand-alone facility, and
consequently do not have an "easy to use" functional interface.

For an example of mouse-sensitive items, try the 3C-X C-B* (List Buffers)
command in the editor.  Try moving the mouse over the list of buffers
and clicking the right-hand button.

The word "typeout" appears here and there in the mouse-sensitive items
facility for historical reasons.  Often mouse-sensitive items are typed
out on top of some other display, such as an editor buffer.  However,
the mouse-sensitive-item facility has nothing to do with the
typeout-window facility.  At this point it would be a fairly big
incompatible change to fix this.
.c [But perhaps we should anyway.]

.defflavor tv:basic-mouse-sensitive-items
Mixing this flavor into a window provides for areas of the screen
which are sensitive to the mouse.  Moving the mouse into such an area
highlights the area by drawing a box around it.  At this point
clicking the mouse performs a user-defined operation.  This flavor is
called 2basic* because it fixes the handling of the mouse by the
window; it will not work to mix it with another flavor that expects to
define some other kind of mouse handling.  However it is less basic
than many basic flavors in that it does not do anything special with
the displayed image of the window.
.end_defflavor

A mouse-sensitive item has a 2type*, which is a keyword which controls what you
can do to it, an 2item*, which is an arbitrary Lisp object associated with it,
and a rectangular area of the window.  Typically something is displayed in that
area at the same time as a mouse-sensitive item is created, using normal stream
output to the window.  Unlike things such as menu items, these mouse-sensitive items
are not a permanent property of the window; they are just as ephemeral as the displayed
text and go away if you clear the window or if typeout wraps around and types over them.
Of course, if you don't type out more items and text than fit in the window,
and never clear the window, then they will be permanent.

Associated with each type is a set of operations that are legal to perform on
items of that type.  One of these operations is selected as the default.  The
3tv:item-type-alist* instance variable is an alist that defines
these.  This alist is composed of elements of the following form:
.lisp
(2type* 2left-button-alternative*
 2documentation*
 (2string* . 2alternative*)       1;A menu item*
 (2string* :value 2alternative*)  1;Another menu item*
 2menu-item*...)		    1;More of them*
.end_lisp
2documentation* is the string to be displayed in the who line
while the mouse is pointing at an item of this type.  The menu items may
also have documentation strings in them.
2documentation* may also be a list of the form
.lisp
(2doc-function* 2label-function*)
.end_lisp
where 2doc-function* is a function that, when applied to a mouse-sensitive item,
returns a documentation string, and 2label-function* is a similar function
that returns a string to use as the menu label, to identify the item
that the menu is going to apply to.

Here is part of the item type alist used in typeout windows of editor windows:
.lisp
((zwei:directory zwei:directory-edit-1
  "Left: Run DIRED on this directory.  Right: menu of View, Edit."
  ("View" :value zwei:view-directory 
   :documentation "View this directory")
  ("Edit" :value zwei:directory-edit-1
   :documentation
   "Run DIRED on this directory."))
 (zwei:file zwei:find-defaulted-file
  "Left: Find file this file.  Right: menu of Load, Find, Compare."
  ("Load" :value zwei:load-defaulted-file
   :documentation "LOAD this file.")
  ("Find" :value zwei:find-defaulted-file
   :documentation "Find file this file.")
  ("Compare" :value zwei:srccom-file
   :documentation
   "Compare this file with the newest version."))
 (zwei:flavor-name zwei:edit-definition-for-mouse
  "Left: Edit definition.  Right: menu of Describe, Edit."
  ("Describe" :value zwei:describe-flavor-internal
   :documentation "Describe this flavor.")
  ("Edit" :value zwei:edit-definition-for-mouse
   :documentation "Edit definition.")))
.end_lisp

When an item is clicked on with the mouse, a blip which is a list of the form
'cindex blip types
'kindex :typeout-execute "blip type"
.lisp
(:typeout-execute 2alternative* 2item*)
.end_lisp
is placed in the window's input buffer.  2item* is the datum
supplied when the item was constructed, whose purpose is to identify
which item was clicked on, and 2alternative* is obtained by looking up
the 2type* of the item in the window's item-type-alist.

If the item is clicked on
with the left mouse button, the 2left-button-alternative* is used in the
3:typeout-execute* blip.  If the item is clicked on with the right
button, the menu items are put into a menu, and the user chooses one.
The value returned by the 3:choose* operation is used as the
2alternative* in the 3:typeout-execute* blip.  Clicking on an item
of a type that is not one of the alternatives in the item-type-alist
just beeps.

For the 3Load* alternative on a file item in the editor, the
blip might be
.lisp
(:typeout-execute zwei:load-defaulted-file
 #fs:logical-pathname "SYS: SYS; QFCTNS LISP")
.end_lisp

.defmethod tv:basic-mouse-sensitive-items :item-type-alist
.defmethod1 tv:basic-mouse-sensitive-items :set-item-type-alist new-item-type-alist
Return or set the item type alist of the window.
.end_defmethod

.definitoption tv:basic-mouse-sensitive-items :item-type-alist alist
Initializes the item type alist of the window.
.end_definitoption

.defspec tv:add-typeout-item-type
The special form
.lisp
(tv:add-typeout-item-type 2alist* 2type* 2name* 2function*
			  2default-p* 2documentation*)
.end_lisp
is used to declare information about a mouse-sensitive item type by
adding an entry to an alist kept in a special variable.  This alist can
then be put into the item-type alist of a mouse-sensitive window, for
instance using the 3:item-type-alist* init-plist option.  Note that
each possible alternative for a particular mouse-sensitive item type is
defined with a separate 3tv:add-typeout-item-type* form; this allows
each alternative to be defined at the place in the program where it is
implemented, rather than collecting all the alternatives into a separate
table.  It also allows new alternatives to be added in a modular
fashion.

2alist* is the special variable containing the alist.  You should
3defvar* it to 3nil* before defining the first item type.  Each program that
uses mouse-sensitive items has its own alist of item types, so that there is no
conflict in the names of the types.  2type* is the keyword symbol for the type
being defined.  2name* is the string that names the operation and
2alternative* is the representation of the alternative (the object to
be put in the second element of the 3:typeout-execute* blip).
2default-p* is optional; if it is supplied and non-3nil*, it
means that this operation is the default performed when you click the left
button on an item of this type.  2documentation* is optional but highly
recommended; it is a string that documents what 2function* does.  When the
user points the mouse at an item of this type, the documentation line at the
bottom of the screen will give the documentation for the default function
(reachable by the left button) and a list of the functions in the menu
(reachable by the right button).  If the user clicks right, calling for a menu,
then the documentation for whichever function in the menu he points the mouse at
will be displayed.

2alist*, 2type*, and 2function* are not evaluated.  2name*, 2default-p*,
and 2documentation* are evaluated.

In the editor, 2alternative* is interpreted (when a
3:typeout-execute* blip is read) as a function to be called, and the
3tv:add-typeout-item-type* form is typically placed right before the
function definition of 2alternative*.
.end_defspec

.need 1500
.nopara
These are the operations used to print items on a window.

.defmethod tv:basic-mouse-sensitive-items :item type item &rest format-args
A new item 2item* of type 2type* is printed, either by calling
3format* with 2format-args*, or by 3princ*'ing 2item* if
2format-args* is 3nil*.

The mouse-sensitive area of the item is whatever space is used up by
printing it, as judged by the motion of the cursor.

The arguments 2item* and 2type* is not necessarily used in printing
the item, but they are used in handling a click on the item.  2type*
is used to look up a function in the item type alist, and 2item* is
placed directly into the 3:typeout-execute* blip.

.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(send standard-output ':item 'zwei:file pathname)
.end_lisp
in the editor, where 3standard-output* is a window that supports
mouse-sensitive items, will 3princ* the value of 3pathname* and make
an item of type 3zwei:file* whose datum is that pathname.
.end_defmethod

.defmethod tv:basic-mouse-sensitive-items :primitive-item type item left top right bottom
.defmethod1 tv:basic-mouse-sensitive-items :primitive-item-outside type item left top right bottom
This operation is used to define a mouse-sensitive item without printing
it.  (Presumably you print it yourself, either before or after.)  The
2type* and 2item* are used as in the 3:item* operation.  The
remaining arguments are coordinates that describe the four edges of the
mouse-sensitive rectangle.

In 3:primitive-item*, the four coordinates are relative to the inside
top left corner of the window (that is, they are cursor positions such
as 3:read-cursorpos* would return).  In 3:primitive-item-outside*,
they are relative to the outside corner of the window (like values of
the instance variables 3tv:cursor-x* and 3tv:cursor-y*).
.end_defmethod

.defmethod tv:basic-mouse-sensitive-items :item-list type list
Several items are printed, arranged neatly in columns, one for each
element of 2list*.  An element of 2list* can be either a string or a
list 3(2name* . 2item*)*.  In the latter case, 2name* (typically
a string) is printed with 2princ*, and 2item* is used as the datum
for the item.  If the element is an atom, that atom serves both to be
3princ*'d and used as the datum.  All the items are of type 2type*.
.end_defmethod

.defmethod tv:basic-mouse-sensitive-items :mouse-sensitive-item x y
Returns a list describing the mouse-sensitive item found at cursor
position 2x*, 2y* in the window, or 3nil* if there is none there.
.lisp
.exdent 96 The list looks like this:
(2type* 2item* 2left* 2top* 2right* 2bottom*)
.end_lisp
The 2type* and 2item* are as specified in the 3:item* operation
and the coordinates are cursor positions (that is, relative to the
outside top left corner of the window).
.end_defmethod

.section Margin Choices
.cindex margin choices
.cindex choice boxes
.setq margin-choice page

A window can be augmented with choice boxes (see (choice-box)) in its
bottom margin using the flavor 3tv:margin-choice-mixin*.  These give
the user a few labeled mouse-sensitive points that are independent of
anything else in the window.

Margin choices are not a complete, stand-alone choice facility and consequently
do not have an "easy to use" functional interface.

For an example of a window with margin choices (as well as choice boxes in its interior),
try the editor command 3Meta-X Kill or Save Buffers*.

.defflavor tv:margin-choice-mixin
Puts choice boxes in the bottom margin, according to a list of choice-box descriptors
which can be specified with the 3:margin-choices* init-plist option
or the 3:set-margin-choices* operation.  A choice-box descriptor is a list,
3(2name* 2state* 2function* 2x1* 2x2*)*.  It is legal to use a longer
list as a choice-box descriptor and store your own data in the additional elements.

2name* is a string that labels the box.  2state* is 3t* if the
box has an "X" in it, 3nil* if it is empty.  2x1* and 2x2* are
used internally to remember where the choices boxes are; they are always
spread out evenly in the available width.

2function* is a function that is called in a separate process if the user
clicks on the choice box.  It receives three arguments: the choice-box descriptor
for the choice box, the "margin region" that contains the choice boxes, and the
2y*-position of the mouse relative to this window.  You probably want to
ignore the last two arguments.  When 2function* is called, 3self* is bound
to the window, so 2function* may use 3(declare (:self-flavor
2flavor*))* to access the window's instance variables.
The structure access functions 3tv:choice-box-name* and 3tv:choice-box-state*
may be of use inside 2function* (they are just more specific names for 3car*
and 3cadr*).  If 2function* changes the state of the choice box, it will
need to refresh the choice boxes by doing
.lisp
(funcall (tv:margin-region-function 2region*) ':refresh 2region*)
.end_lisp
where 2region* is its second argument, which is why that argument is passed.

3tv:margin-choice-mixin* contains 3tv:margin-region-mixin* as an
included flavor; this means approximately that
3tv:margin-region-mixin* will appear in any combination right after
3tv:margin-choice-mixin* if it is not explicitly specified to appear
somewhere else.  The position of 3tv:margin-region-mixin* controls
where the choice boxes appear in relation to the other margin items
(borders, labels. etc).  See (margins).
.end_defflavor

.definitoption tv:margin-choice-mixin :margin-choices choices
2choices* is a list of choice-box descriptors, described above.
A line of choice-boxes will appear in the bottom margin of the window.
If 2choices* is 3nil*, there will be no choice boxes and no
space for them in the bottom margin; however, the window will still be
capable of accepting the 3:set-margin-choices* operation to create
a line of choice boxes later.
.end_definitoption

.defmethod tv:margin-choice-mixin :set-margin-choices choices
Changes the set of margin choices according to 2choices*, which is 3nil*
to turn them off or a list of choice-box descriptors, described above.
If the choice boxes are turned on or off, the size of the window's bottom
margin will change accordingly.
.end_defmethod

.definstvar tv:margin-choice-mixin tv:margin-choices
A list of margin choices, or 3nil*.
.end_definstvar

To get a menu with margin choices, it is best to use
3tv:menu-margin-choice-mixin* ((tv:menu-margin-choice-mixin-flavor)),
which goes to a little extra trouble to interface the margin choices to
the menu.
