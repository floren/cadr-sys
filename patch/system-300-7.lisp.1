(DEFUN LOAD-PATCHES (&REST OPTIONS &AUX TEM SOMETHING-CHANGED)
  "Load any new patches for one or more systems.
Options can include these symbols:
 :NOSELECTIVE - don't ask about each patch.
 :SILENT or :NOWARN - don't print out any information on loading patches
   (and also don't ask).
 :VERBOSE - says to print out information about loading each patch.
   This is the default and is only turned off by :silent and :nowarn.
 :UNRELEASED - says to load or consider unreleased patches.
   Once unreleased patches have been loaded, a band may not be dumped.
 :FORCE-UNFINISHED - load all patches that have not been finished yet,
   if they have QFASL files.  This is good for testing patches.
 :NOOP - do nothing
 :SITE - load latest site configuration info.
 :NOSITE - do not load latest site configuration info.
   :SITE is the default unless systems to load patches for are specified.
 :COMPILE - compile a patch if only source is found

Options can also include :SYSTEMS followed by a list of systems to load patches for.
One or more names of systems are also allowed.

LOAD-PATCHES returns T if any patches were loaded, otherwise NIL."
