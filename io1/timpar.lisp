;;;; Defining patterns.

;;; A pattern is a list of N pattern elements, which are compared one-for-one
;;; with the first N elements of the token list we are analyzing.  Each
;;; pattern element may be:
;;; (a) A symbol or fixnum, which matches exactly that symbol or fixnum.
;;; (b) A list whose CAR is a "special pattern" symbol, in which case a special
;;;        function associated with that symbol is invoked.
;;; (c) A list of one symbol, which is interpreted as an arbitrary predicate
;;;        of one argument, which is applied to the token and should return
;;;        true if the token "matches".
;;;
;;; Note: symbols with FIXNUM-STRING properties are treated as if they
;;; were fixnums, rather than symbols.  This is for English cardinal and
;;; ordinal numbers.
;;;
;;; The following special pattern symbols exist, with the following special "forms":
;;;  (FIXP), which matches any fixnum.
;;;  (FIXP <n>), which matches any fixnum with exactly n digits.
;;;  (FIXP <m> <n>), which matches any fixnum with between m and n digits inclusive.
;;;  (FRACTION), which matches any fraction, with articles before or after.
;;;    These fractions are phrases like "a half", not numbers and slashes.
;;;  (FRACTION T), which matches any fraction, not including articles after.
;;;  (ANY-OF <pattern-element> <pattern-element> ...), which matches if any of the
;;;    pattern elements match.
;;;  (GET <property-indicator>), which matches if the token is a symbol with a
;;;    non-NIL <property-indicator> property.
;;;  (ANY), which matches any single token.

;;; Examples:
;;;   ((FIXP 1 2) /: (FIXP 2) /: (FIXP 2))    Matches 11:30:15
;;;   ((GET MONTH) (FIXP 1 2) /, (FIXP 4))    Matches Jan 23, 1980
;;;   (12. (GET MERIDIAN))                    Matches 12 pm or 12 am
;;;   ()                                      Matches anything
;;;   ((ANY))                                 Matches anything except no tokens.

;;; The special form DEFPATTERN defines a pattern, information about when to try to
;;; match it, and what to do if it is matched.  The form looks like this:
;;; (DEFPATTERN <from-state> <pattern> <to-state> <lambda-list> . <body>)
;;; The parser has a state, represented by a symbol.
;;; It finds all the DEFPATTERNs for its current
;;; state by finding all those with <from-state> EQ to the current state.
;;; It applies each pattern in succession.  When it finds a pattern that
;;; matches, it invokes the associated function (defined by the <lambda-list>
;;; and <body> of the DEFPATTERN) and sets the state to <to-state>; it also
;;; CDRs off the matched portion of the token list, proceeding with the rest
;;; of the list.  The argument to the function defined by DEFPATTERN are
;;; all those tokens in the token list that matched the pattern, except
;;; those that were expressed in the pattern as symbols or fixnums (since
;;; these are just constants, the function is not interested in them).
;;; (Those that were expressed as ANY-OF pattern elements ARE passed
;;; to the function, even if the token is a constant, just in case the
;;; function cares which of the choices was taken.
;;;
;;; The parse proceeds until there are no tokens left and the state
;;; has a FINAL-STATE property of T.
;;;
;;; There is another version of DEFPATTERN called DEFPATTERN-PEEK, which
;;; is the same except that it "looks ahead" at the tokens, without
;;; passing over them.  Also, the tokens are not passed to the function;
;;; the function must take zero arguments.
;;;
;;; NOTE that the order of DEFPATTERNs in this file is significant, and
;;; defines the order in which patterns are checked.
;;;
;;; A data structure that allows the parser to find all the patterns is
;;; constructed at LOAD-time.  A list of known states is maintained as
;;; the value of *STATES*.  Each state is given a PATTERNS property,
;;; consisting of a list of elements of the form:
;;;  (<pattern> <to-state> <function-to-call> <skip-tokens>)
;;; These lists are CONSed up in reverse order, and NREVERSEd at the end.
;;; <skip-tokens> is true for DEFPATTERN and false for DEFPATTERN-PEEK.
