	zwei:*host-for-bug-reports* is supposed to be a host, not a string.
	Many other people have reported this, but apparently our replies haven't
	hit everybody.  Therefore, I am sending this to LispM-Uses.

    I've found it helpful to have an extended command in ZMAIL that changes the
    mail host.  It's very helpful when the mail host goes down or when it's
    too busy to accept incoming mail (MC does that a lot).  The vanilla world
    should have such a thing.

I guess I don't know what this has to do with
zwei:*host-for-bug-reports*.  There is another variable which forces
mail to go through a particular host.  I'm sorry, but if you want to set
that, you will have to live with it and distribute yoru tool to your
friends.  I don't think something like it will go in the system because
mail sending cooperates with the namespace system to find SOME
store-and-forward mailer that is up.  We sometimes have 3 of our 5 or 6
mailers down at the same time, yet mail still gets through because the
namespace is able to find a mailer that is up.  There shouldn't be any
need for your tool.

For the applications you have in mind (mail host down or busy), I really think
you want this set to NIL, so that ZMail will work to find another mailer.  If
you do need it for some reason, use it as a temporary measure.  Setting it in
your init file is an easy way to get confused later.  I guess I don't believe
that you need to set it often enough to write a supporting command.

I've seen this happen to me too. It seems that LOADED-BAND-NAME can only
be so many characters long. The fep file probably has the line 
"LOAD WORLD FEP0:>Release-5-2-prime.load.1" in it, and the part of the
name of the band is truncated to "FEP0:>Release-5-2-prime.load."
This indeed is a bug, but I worked around it by changing my fep files to
not have the ".1" at the end of the band name.

System 98 has a microcode bug that wedges the Chaos Net.
Doing a hostat is the easiest way to wedge the net.

MIT users should use Systems 94,97 or 99 in the mean time.

Note that cadr2 and cadr23 on the 7th floor do not have
enough working Control Memory to run system 99.

I saw this once when we still had the machine at SCRC.  I had hoped that
swapping a memory board fixed it.  It is probably a hardware problem.

This could be caused by a bit in the stack getting set spuriously.  I think someone
said that you had field service replace a bad DP board; this sounds like the spare
was bad, too, or there is so more systemic problem with the machine.

	To:   bug-lispm%MIT-OZ@MIT-MC.ARPA
	Subject: System 98


	System 98 has a microcode bug that wedges the Chaos Net.
	Doing a hostat is the easiest way to wedge the net.

The bug does not appear to be in the microcode. 
The problem is with the new site files (ie. the other new
Namespace problems).  Specifically, some unix hosts (to wit, 
MIT-APHRODITE don't seem to have gotten compiled properly.
The sign of this is things like [Unable to change the flavor of site ....]

What this means is that (send (si:parse-host "aphrodite") :send-if-handles
   :chaos-address) returns NIL, and sending it the message :chaos-address
of courses gets an error.  However, sending the message :network-addresses shows
the correct chaos address.   Since this is fixed in a later release, I made
a simple kludge which causes HOSTAT and similar functions to work.
The file to load is oz:ps:<x.hdt>fix-hostat.qfasl   
I did not bother to install this for several reasons.

Reply-To: SAZ@MIT-OZ


Could someone explain to me how I am supposed to wake the 3600's
supdup connection if I have typed ahead all pertinent login info
and wish to retain my prompt for the first sysmsg?

e.g.;

connect to host: oz
(screen clears and subliminal AI Lab cruft appears, to be replaced by
new cruft and pertinent downtime or disk space notifications, followed
by a prompt)
@ <--- cursor sits at position indicated, even though I have typed "saz password"
       ahead of time.  It is only after I type a space bar or some other char
       that the uname and password are output to the screen (ie, to the command
       processor).  But that space bar I typed in to force out the chars in 
       typeahead is still there!  The command proc. parses it as soon as it is
       finished logging me in, such that the following brain-dead scenario
       occurs:

@saz 
[PCL COMMAND DEFINED]
fortune message:  Good evening, saz...
                    Man does not live by bread alone -- he must also have dough for the weekends.
Zippy message:  Has Tellulah Bankhead taken out the cat yet?  Or is this a dream?
[End of LOGIN.CMD]
--Msgs-- <---Where I would LIKE the cursor to be right now...but now!  the space bar is now parsed.
(screen clears) (!!!)
First sysmsg appears, asking me if I'd like to see
--More-- <---Final position of cursor.

I hope I have outlined the situation clearly.  I am now going to log out and reestablish
a connection trying various ascii and non-ascii LM chars to see if they work.  It would
be nice to know exactly why I have to search for a kludgey solution.

No.  You are missing the point:  FUNCTION C-C SHOULD ONLY EFFECT THE
PORTION OF THE TYPEOUT WINDOW THAT IS EXPOSED.  The Zmacs window pane
underneath has no idea that someone inverted part of it.  That you can
recover from the bug is nice, but it does not fix the bug.  I didn't try
REFRESH, but Function REFRESH does work, and c-L leaves a turd at the
very bottom of the Zmacs window pane.

Subject: supdup
To: bug-lispm@MIT-OZ



When supdup'ing from a 3600 to a unix-running vax (i.e. prep),
after the first screen of data, the first character on each line
starts to disapear as soon as the newline character
is received.

i.e., while the first character if each line is printed,
it is erased when the cursor moves down to the next line.

This happens on both prep and mit-vx.

The problem goes away for one screen full if you do a clear.

Try it, you'll see what I mean.

    No.  You are missing the point:

Yup, I'm so used to this behavior that I could not see it as a bug until my
nose was rubbed in it (yechh, what a repulsive concept that mixed
metaphor suggests).
				     FUNCTION C-C SHOULD ONLY EFFECT THE
    PORTION OF THE TYPEOUT WINDOW THAT IS EXPOSED.

Right, that is the crux of the matter.  I just looked into it and it turned
out to be trivial to fix.  You'll probably see the correct behavior in
release 6.

In the same vein, 3600's don't supdup to [mit-project-athena] 750's
running Berkly 4.2 [plus many athena specific system modifications].
All kinds of control characters get printed to the screen.

	From: Christopher R. Eliot <CRE @ MIT-MC>

	The font change functions (e.g. C-X C-J) in Zwei put the font change indicators
	in the wrong place.

	;;; -*- Fonts: CPTFONT,CPTFONTB,CPTFONTI -*-
	.fi
	Foo Bar
	1baz
	0.nf

    It wasn't intended to be used this way.

Perhaps not, but it's awfully handy.

	      The reason the 0 is on the next line is that the font is only
    changed when it has to be.

    I guess it wouldn't hurt very much to make Zwei return to font 0 at the
    end of every line when writing a fonted file, 

Seems to me that the right thing is a generalized lookahead across
whitespace -- <Space> characters are often inserted in the current font,
whichever it was, so the font info attached to them should not be
regarded as significant (? at least this should be an option).  The idea
is that if you're changing back to the previous font (*, which, if
you're not generating, you should be), the change happens before the next
whitespace; otherwise, it happens after, so 

  Font->  000?111?000      (? -> irrelevant)
  Char->  the foo bar

gets written out as

  the 1foo* bar

i.e. the font switches get wrapped immediately around "foo" regardless
of how much whitespace appears on either side of it.

While you're at it, how about bringing Zmacs into line with every other
multi-font editor in the world (well, every one I've ever seen), and
take the font for self-insertion from the character to the left (except
at the beginning of a paragraph, where you take the character
immediately to the right), except immediately after a
change-current-font command?  This behavior seems pretty universally
regarded as within epsilon (sorry) of DWIM.  (Now if you could only do
something similar for the fill column and the fill prefix!  Alas, the
limitations of pure-character-stream editors...)

BTW, Zmacs in both Release 5.1 and System 98.78 have a bug that if you
have two windows, and one window's buffer has multiple fonts and the
other doesn't, then if you switch windows (c-X O or mouse-left) from the
fonted window (the top, let's say) to the bottom, the current-font
information does not get removed from the mode line.  Conversely, if by
switching buffers in the bottom window, you get the mode line to be
correct, then when you switch back to the top window the font
information does not reappear.  If I remember correctly, in 5.1 this
lossage even propagates across multiple ZMACS-FRAMEs.  I wrote a patch
for 5.1 for this problem -- get Phill Apley at Bitstream to give you a
tape (alas, they have no modems).

I see.  FEP0:>Release-5-2-Bulletin.load. is a string exactly 32
characters long, which is the maximum string allocated for this variable
in Release 5.  (Please don't try to change it; the FEP has to be able to
store into it.)  In Release 6, this string has a length of 64, which is
sufficient for a fully loaded name (max 32), type (max 4) and version
(realistically small), and even a short directory name.  Rename the file
to 
	FEP0:>Release-5-2-Bull.load.1

I had Mark Robbins replace the DP board way back when the garbage
collector didn't work, and then the garbage collector worked. I just
looked in the log book, and he didn't record the fact that he replaced
the DP board. The only record in the log book is the one for final
factory inspection. I will have him replace the DP board again, and
watch the machine to see if it flakes again, as the current bug is only
intermittent.

It sounds like the problem with spurious meter-function-exit traps is known
to have occurred on that machine two different DP boards (the one it had
at SCRC before it was called REAGAN, and the one that Mark Robbins put in
to fix the GC).  This decreases the probability that the problem is the DP
board.  On the other hand, since the logbook did not say that the DP board
was replaced, perhaps that is not what was actually done to make the GC work.
It would help to check the clocks and the power supplies, and then to swap
all the processor boards, including the DP, one at a time.  I would start
with the SQ.

    When supdup'ing from a 3600 to a unix-running vax (i.e. prep),after the first screen of data, the first character on each line
    starts to disapear as soon as the newline character
    is received.

    i.e., while the first character if each line is printed,
    it is erased when the cursor moves down to the next line.

    This happens on both prep and mit-vx.The problem goes away for one screen full if you do a clear.

    Try it, you'll see what I mean.

pertain to MIT machines. Please perform them in a timely manner, or let

This is a long standing bug in the 20X SUPDUP server that was discussed
in December '82, probably on Bug-OZ.  ITS has a similar problem, but has
a much much narrower timing window.

    Reply-To: SAZ@MIT-OZ


    Could someone explain to me how I am supposed to wake the 3600's
    supdup connection if I have typed ahead all pertinent login info
    and wish to retain my prompt for the first sysmsg?

    e.g.;

    connect to host: oz
    (screen clears and subliminal AI Lab cruft appears, to be replaced by
    new cruft and pertinent downtime or disk space notifications, followed
    by a prompt)
    @ <--- cursor sits at position indicated, even though I have typed "saz password"
	   ahead of time.  It is only after I type a space bar or some other char
	   that the uname and password are output to the screen (ie, to the command
	   processor).  But that space bar I typed in to force out the chars in 
	   typeahead is still there!  The command proc. parses it as soon as it is
	   finished logging me in, such that the following brain-dead scenario
	   occurs:

    @saz 
    [PCL COMMAND DEFINED]
    fortune message:  Good evening, saz...
			Man does not live by bread alone -- he must also have dough for the weekends.
    Zippy message:  Has Tellulah Bankhead taken out the cat yet?  Or is this a dream?
    [End of LOGIN.CMD]
    --Msgs-- <---Where I would LIKE the cursor to be right now...but now!  the space bar is now parsed.
    (screen clears) (!!!)
    First sysmsg appears, asking me if I'd like to see
    --More-- <---Final position of cursor.

    I hope I have outlined the situation clearly.  I am now going to log out and reestablish
    a connection trying various ascii and non-ascii LM chars to see if they work.  It would
    be nice to know exactly why I have to search for a kludgey solution.

	In the same vein, 3600's don't supdup to [mit-project-athena] 750's
	running Berkly 4.2 [plus many athena specific system modifications].
	All kinds of control characters get printed to the screen.

This sounds like the thing called SUPDUP on the vax isn't really SUPDUP
because it is violating protocol left, right and sideways.

    Was this with SUPDUP over TCP or SUPDUP over CHAOS?

    I wasn't able to reproduce this in the latest system SUPDUPing to CHARON
    using Chaos.

Assuming CHARON is representative, I guess my that conjecture isn't
valid.

Yes.

Actually, it was not gratuitous.  The release 5 TCP gateway stuff died a
natural death, succumbing to changes in the network system.  We finally
got rid of it so that people wouldn't expect it to work and be
disappointed.  The version supplied with TCP has been modified to be
compatible with real TCP and had lots of other bugs fixed.  Having all
of the TCP- and Internet-related code in one system has made maintenance
much simpler.

I would hope that MIT will buy TCP so that it can talk TCP directly.  We
certainly had a lot of interest on the recently concluded beta-test.  I
don't believe that the price is excessive considering what you get.

    Namespace Server, on Lisp Machine Ronald Reagan:

    Well, I recently changed PREP from a UNIX to a UNIX42.
    I was hoping that the Namespace system wouldn't lose this badly.
    This machine is the primary server for the MIT namespace, yet 
    It has forgotten all information about PREP from the MIT
    namespace object MIT|PREP, and only knows about INTERNET|PREP
    now. DEGAS and CEZANNE are broken in the same way.
    *SIGH*

    >>Error: PREP does not support LOGIN in a reachable way.
    While in the function NET:INVOKE-SERVICE-ON-HOST  TELNET:GET-LOGIN-CONNECTION  (:METHOD TELNET:NVT-WINDOW :CONNECT)

I did some minor surgery on Reagan and fixed this.  This sort of problem
shouldn't happen with release 6.

    	In the same vein, 3600's don't supdup to [mit-project-athena] 750's
    	running Berkly 4.2 [plus many athena specific system modifications].
    	All kinds of control characters get printed to the screen.

    This sounds like the thing called SUPDUP on the vax isn't really SUPDUP
    because it is violating protocol left, right and sideways.

        Was this with SUPDUP over TCP or SUPDUP over CHAOS?

        I wasn't able to reproduce this in the latest system SUPDUPing to CHARON
        using Chaos.

    Assuming CHARON is representative, I guess my that conjecture isn't
    valid.

Well, there are a number of things here that seem to be confusing
people. First of all, only three of four (possibly five) Athena
machines are actually on the Chaosnet.  Charon is one of them, and
thus is not representative.  Also no Athena machine supports Internet
SUPDUP.  Finally, as we all know the unix SUPDUP support is pretty
pathetic, although the stuff running on the Athena machines on the
Chaosnet is no worse than what you find on many other Unix's.

On the issue of garbage on the screen -- if it is typing lots of ^@ 's
at you, try telling unix "stty nl0".  It also gets confused if
overstriking is turned off.

the specific lossage came about by trying to compile a form like

i expect this but since condition-case expands into some kind of COND, the
actual error message being about an error in the body of a COND could potentially
be confusing.

    I understand why the namespace servers for the namespaces SCRC, ARPANET,
    INTERNET, SCRC, SCH, SWW, and SPA don't allow randoms at MIT to make
    changes to them, but the current system of us having to ask someone over
    at SCRC to make changes in their spare time is is hardly optimal. I have
    asked for some of these changes more than a week ago. These changes only
    pertain to MIT machines. Please perform them in a timely manner, or let
    us have some mechanism for doing them here.

In release 6 there will be a machanism to declare a host a secondary for
all namespaces.

    host INTERNET|MIT-PREP:	change system type to UNIX42

    host ARPANET|MIT-PREP:	change system type to UNIX42

    host INTERNET|MIT-VAX:	change system type to UNIX42

    host ARPANET|MIT-VAX:	change system type to UNIX42

    host INTERNET|MIT-HERMES: change system type to UNIX42

    host ARPANET|MIT-HERMES: change system type to UNIX42

    host INTERNET|MIT-VAX:	change system type to UNIX42

    host ARPANET|MIT-VAX:	change system type to UNIX42

    host INTERNET|MIT-HTVAX: change system type to UNIX42

    host ARPANET|MIT-HTVAX: change system type to UNIX42

    namespace INTERNET:	add REAGAN as a secondary 

    namespace SCRC:		add REAGAN as a secondary 

All done.

    namespace SCH:		add REAGAN as a secondary 
			    remove POLAR as a secondary

    namespace SPA:		add REAGAN as a secondary 
			    remove POLAR as a secondary

    namespace SWW:		add REAGAN as a secondary 
			    remove POLAR as a secondary

These are harder because they run release 5.2 software.  I'll work on
them.

Subject: A message from Goldy
To:   bug-lispm@oz

Goldy got an error in the scheduler in SYS:TRANSPORT-INTERNAL saying
"Internal error in the GC... Non enclosing structure" and asked me to
report it.  The GC count was 16 according to GC-STATUS.  It was pretty
broken, so I couldn't look around much at it.

I have been noticing a general lossage on Goldy that seems to be
somewhat repeatable (although each repitition takes many days) that
may be related to the GC.  To summarize about four occasions in the
last several months, what seems to happen is that array leaders end up
with garbage in them.  This generally breaks either the namespace
server or the file server (as that's all Goldy does).  Sometimes it
will also report disk errors while serving, although this may also be
caused by the trashed array leaders.  Goldy does not have much memory
(1024K) so it has to do a lot of paging while it's doing the GCing and
serving.  It also pages off of two different disks.

Subject: The L command in Zmail (Rel4)
To: BUG-LISPM at MIT-MC

In Zmail in Symbolics 3600 Release 4.5 on Merlin:

I am very bothered that the L command reads a set of labels to replace
the message labels with, rather than a set to add to the message labels.
If I have a message with 5 labels, I have to type six names in order to
add a label. Also, if I misspell a label, a spurious label gets created
which I cannot get rid of. Also, I cannot abbreviate a label because
there is no completion available. This is amazingly tedious.

Especially since Babyl has the behavior I'm asking for, it's frustrating
because I frequently forget and lose several labels on a message when I
think I'm just adding one. Sometimes I don't notice that I've done this
and the effect can be very confusing.

Also, I'd like a -L command to remove a certain set of labels (leaving
the rest alone). This behavior is also like Babyl.

Please no arguments about how I should be using a mouse to change only
one label.  I'm a touch typist and 3600 mice are all-too-frequently
accompanied by a tracking surface that has been worn smooth, rendering
the mouse unable to move reliably because it can't get any traction.

	Date: Tuesday, 6 November 1984, 14:11-EST
	From: Kent M Pitman <kmp at MIT-MC>

	In Zmail in Symbolics 3600 Release 4.5 ... on Merlin:

	... I tried the Map Over menu to see if there was a way to remove
	keywords via map, but there is not. ...

    Maybe I don't understand what you are asking, but what's wrong with 
    [R: Map Over / Unkeywords], I mean besides the grammer?

Actually, I thought I'd looked carefully at the menu and didn't see it.
So while I agree this means it could have been done, it wasn't "obvious".
I don't find the name "Unkeywords" very readable. "Keywords" isn't a verb,
but I don't mind it being on a menu since I think "Hack keywords." But
I don't like "Unkeywords" since I don't think "Hack unkeywords". 

I'll bet it's the fact that the "Add" one is just called "Keywords" 
that caused me to not see anything else. It sounds too generic. Also, I'd
have expected the two to appear vertically next to each other, not 
horizontally next to each other. Many menus are column oriented and I'm
more adjusted to scanning down columns than cross-ways. I'm not as likely
to notice the relation between items which are horizontally adjacent as
I am items that are vertically adjacent. I realize that 
makes the menu harder to lay out since the geometry is probably just
"fill" style, but if doing something to get past that makes the menu
more readable, I encourage it.

As far as the items themselves, they could either be collapsed from 
"Keywords" into "Add/Remove Keywords" (flushing "Unkeywords") so that
Left-Click could do the Add and Middle-Click could do the Remove, or
there could be two menu items but they could be called something more
suggestive -- eg, "Add Keywords" and "Remove Keywords".

    From: Kent M Pitman <kmp at MIT-MC>

    In Zmail in Symbolics 3600 Release 4.5 on Merlin:

    I am very bothered that the L command reads a set of labels to replace
    the message labels with, rather than a set to add to the message labels.
    If I have a message with 5 labels, I have to type six names in order to
    add a label. Also, if I misspell a label, a spurious label gets created
    which I cannot get rid of. Also, I cannot abbreviate a label because
    there is no completion available. This is amazingly tedious.

    Especially since Babyl has the behavior I'm asking for, it's frustrating
    because I frequently forget and lose several labels on a message when I
    think I'm just adding one. Sometimes I don't notice that I've done this
    and the effect can be very confusing.

    Also, I'd like a -L command to remove a certain set of labels (leaving
    the rest alone). This behavior is also like Babyl.

    Please no arguments about how I should be using a mouse to change only
    one label.  I'm a touch typist and 3600 mice are all-too-frequently
    accompanied by a tracking surface that has been worn smooth, rendering
    the mouse unable to move reliably because it can't get any traction.

OK, but the mouse interface, that is, the menu provided for
[Keywords(R)], is really the answer to all your points.  However, in
Release 5 and later (I have no way to try this out in Rel 4) the L
command is pretty useful too (if you intuit the right behavior), in that
c-m-Y will yank into the minibuffer the current list of keywords.  You
can then add new labels and edit the old ones.

Unfortunately, you have to guess that c-m-Y will do that.  I suppose the
prompt message should be improved.

The right solution for your specifications, and in general for the
extraordinarily schizoid conglomeration of mouse and keyboard interface
that Zmail has, is to provide a Command Processor interface in Zmail.
This is a post-release-6 goal.

    In Zmail in Symbolics 3600 Release 4.5 on Merlin:

    The documentation for the "S" command (COM-ZMAIL-SAVE) in ZMail
    says something about "Right gives menu of ...". Since "S" is not
    a mouse command, this documentation is spurious.

Zmail is rife with this sort of thing.  You'll find that <help>x, for
most values of x, produces a similar message, in which mouse selection
options are intermixed with the operations for plain and
argument-bearing keyboard input.  For instance, see <help>R.  

These help texts need a thorough revamping.

The file attribute list could be augmented with a Bugs-To field.
This could be saved on the pathname so it would be accessible from the 
source-file-name property of each function.  C-M in the debugger could look
for this and initialize the TO field to go to that person.  This would
probably reduce the number of bug reports incorectly sent to BUG-LISPM,
and could increase the number of bug-reports which get to the people who
should see them.

There are some obvious scoping problems, which are probably unsolvable.
Bugs are often caught by error checking in working code, so the user
might have to go down the stack to find a function that seems responsible
for the problem.  Alternatively the bug report could be sent the maintainers
of all functions active on the stack.  This seems wrong, but it might
not be as bad as it seems, since in most cases this would only be BUG-LISPM
and one application program.

	Experimental RELATUS 131.119, FEP 22, on Lisp Machine Jim Morrison:

	These used to work in 5.1.  Why were they broken in 5.2?  It sure seems pretty
	bogus to gratuitously break functionality like this in a released system.
	Does this mean that MIT has to pay N thousands to $ to get it back by buying
	TCP?
    ...
    I would hope that MIT will buy TCP so that it can talk TCP directly.  We
    certainly had a lot of interest on the recently concluded beta-test.  I
    don't believe that the price is excessive considering what you get.

I'm not sure I'm allowed to say this, but since it should be on the
price list I'm going to say it anyway.  Just in case, I'll leave out
some numbers.  The pricing strategy is IP/TCP for $nK per machine up to
X machines, at which point the site gets a site license and the cost per
additional machine above X is for administrative registration ($100 I
think).  Guessing on the number of machines MIT has, and assuming 80%
will want TCP, the cost per machine is about $450 (per machine at MIT).
Therefore, your N is .45.  Additionally, you will get a LOT LOT more out
of this TCP/IP than you did with the old gateway code.  For example, you
can have a LISPM be a server on the Internet instead of just a user.

P.S.:  Trying to keep the old code working would be imitating IBM: keep
things working forever.  It is somewhat unfortunate (I was upset) that
TCP gateway service fell into this category.  Note also this only
affects MIT, since MIT is the only site to have such a CHAOS->TCP
gateway service.

    Goldy got an error in the scheduler in SYS:TRANSPORT-INTERNAL saying
    "Internal error in the GC... Non enclosing structure" and asked me to
    report it.  The GC count was 16 according to GC-STATUS.  It was pretty
    broken, so I couldn't look around much at it.

c-M would have been helpful, had you been able to save the result.  I
assume you are running the latest 5.2 on Goldy.  I'd be curious to know
if you have an IO6 or an IO2 on Goldy.  The microcode name it uses is
good enough to tell me.

    I have been noticing a general lossage on Goldy that seems to be
    somewhat repeatable (although each repitition takes many days) that
    may be related to the GC.  To summarize about four occasions in the
    last several months, what seems to happen is that array leaders end up
    with garbage in them.  This generally breaks either the namespace
    server or the file server (as that's all Goldy does).  Sometimes it
    will also report disk errors while serving, although this may also be
    caused by the trashed array leaders.  Goldy does not have much memory
    (1024K) so it has to do a lot of paging while it's doing the GCing and
    serving.  It also pages off of two different disks.

There have been random reports from SCH about this same class of error.
Without poking around (SCH isn't very accessible) I can never determine
much of what went on.

    Would it be possible to separate MIT specific business from the rest
    of the gripes useful to the community of SLU in general ?
    You easterner could create a MIT-BUG-LISPM to report MIT specific problems.

    Any takers ?

    That would cut in half (+/- 25%) the number of messages in my mail box.

[Unless some mailing list accidentally forwards to Bug-LispM@oz, or
vice-versa, I can only assume you really meant to send this to
Bug-LispM@oz.]

Bug-LispM@OZ  >>>>>IS<<<<< the MIT specific Bug-LispM mailing list.
It also happens to be accessible to the outside world, which is not the
case of most Bug-LispM@site mailing lists.  It's all or nothing; either
get the bugs MIT reports, complete with MIT specific problems, or don't
get them.  Maybe you should look into your area Users's Group.

	From: Kent M Pitman <kmp at MIT-MC>

	In Zmail in Symbolics 3600 Release 4.5 on Merlin:

	I am very bothered that the L command reads a set of labels to replace
	the message labels with, rather than a set to add to the message labels.
	If I have a message with 5 labels, I have to type six names in order to
	add a label. Also, if I misspell a label, a spurious label gets created
	which I cannot get rid of. Also, I cannot abbreviate a label because
	there is no completion available. This is amazingly tedious.

	Especially since Babyl has the behavior I'm asking for, it's frustrating
	because I frequently forget and lose several labels on a message when I
	think I'm just adding one. Sometimes I don't notice that I've done this
	and the effect can be very confusing.

	Also, I'd like a -L command to remove a certain set of labels (leaving
	the rest alone). This behavior is also like Babyl.

	Please no arguments about how I should be using a mouse to change only
	one label.  I'm a touch typist and 3600 mice are all-too-frequently
	accompanied by a tracking surface that has been worn smooth, rendering
	the mouse unable to move reliably because it can't get any traction.

    OK, but the mouse interface, that is, the menu provided for
    [Keywords(R)], is really the answer to all your points.  
All except his point about not being able to use the mouse.  I can also
make a point that I don't WANT to use the mouse because I am a touch
typist.
    However, in
    Release 5 and later (I have no way to try this out in Rel 4) the L
    command is pretty useful too (if you intuit the right behavior), in that
    c-m-Y will yank into the minibuffer the current list of keywords.  You
    can then add new labels and edit the old ones.

    Unfortunately, you have to guess that c-m-Y will do that.  I suppose the
    prompt message should be improved.

    The right solution for your specifications, and in general for the
    extraordinarily schizoid conglomeration of mouse and keyboard interface
    that Zmail has, is to provide a Command Processor interface in Zmail.
    This is a post-release-6 goal.

There are some other things that can be done.  [First a Multics aside.
On Multics, this would be done as 3 commands:
	+L to add a keyword
	 L to set the keywords
	-L to remove a keyword.]
I would suggest putting in a flag, defaulting ON, such that typing L
automatically does a c-m-Y.  (I know this isn't what BABYL does.)  This
would make it obvious that the keywords are being edited.  I think this
should be investigated for 6.0 or 6.1.

To add completion, it would have to figure out which keyword you are
editing when you hit <Complete>, or something.  For the future,
probably.

As for lack of error checking for misspelled keywords, I sometimes like
being able to add a new keyword without an excess of interface.  Maybe
this should only be allowed with a numeric argument to L?  I think this
should be investigated for 6.0 or 6.1.

There should also be a keyword editor so you can delete keywords (after
verifying none of the loaded files use them).  For the future,
probably.  There should also be an automatic version which marks all
unused keywords for deletion.

It's got an IO2.  c-M worked well enough for me to get the buffer for
mail, but any key I typed at that point would put me back into the
scheduler error, so I couldn't save it for you.  Maybe next time it
will  be c-Mable.  As far as the frames go, I think it was just
process-scheduler and then the transport-internal error.

Sending mail takes an inordinate amount of time due to namespace connecting.
To send a simple piece of mail to OZ, I had to connect to Godzilla, Riverside,
Stony-Brook, and Goldilocks (three or four times to Goldilocks).  After a
while, I gave up, inhibited validity checking, set ZWEI:*MAIL-NETWORK-HOST* to
(NET:PARSE-HOST 'MC) and resent the mail.  It went off right away.  No random
connections to everywhere.   

Am I REALLY going to lose by doing this?  It sure saves a lot of grief.

    Sending mail takes an inordinate amount of time due to namespace connecting.
    To send a simple piece of mail to OZ, I had to connect to Godzilla, Riverside,
    Stony-Brook, and Goldilocks (three or four times to Goldilocks).  After a
    while, I gave up, inhibited validity checking, set ZWEI:*MAIL-NETWORK-HOST* to
    (NET:PARSE-HOST 'MC) and resent the mail.  It went off right away.  No random
    connections to everywhere.   

    Am I REALLY going to lose by doing this?  It sure saves a lot of grief.

No, you won't lose unless MC is down.  This behavior (connecting all
over the place) should be a lot better in the next release.

Your bug is that you are running microcode 313 in Release 5.  I'm
surprised your machine didn't crash before this.  I don't know how you
got that microcode (I have a guess), and I suggest you ask whoever gave
it to you to make an FPA microcode that will work for Release 5.

    Clicked on edit screen, move multiple.  I was over an editor with
    multiple windows.  When I moved the mouse, little mouse turds were left
    all over the place.

The microcode does more error checking than it used to.  If it didn't,
floating point numbers wouldn't have been caught.  The corresponding
Lisp code in Release 6 sets up the NIL values you see in locals 9
through 38 with fixnums so the microcode doesn't trip.

    As for lack of error checking for misspelled keywords, I sometimes like
    being able to add a new keyword without an excess of interface.  Maybe
    this should only be allowed with a numeric argument to L?  I think this
    should be investigated for 6.0 or 6.1.
It should query "Really add the new keyword ospys (Y or N)? ". I have been
screwed by this too many times to count.  Is that an acceptable compromise?
    There should also be a keyword editor so you can delete keywords (after
    verifying none of the loaded files use them).  For the future,
    probably.  There should also be an automatic version which marks all
    unused keywords for deletion.
Yes.  Currently, you cannot get a keyword out of the KEYWORDS menu
except by cold boot or the Zmail equivalent thereof, if that.

You're using an unreleased microcode in a world which is incompatible
with it.  Scott Cyphers "borrowed" that microcode to check out the FPA.
I don't guess anyone minds if you use it, but don't complain when it
doesn't work.  [It does fix an FPA bug in (FLOAT fixnum), though.]

You have to cold boot zmail and edit your BABYL file before zmail reads
it back in.  Once a keyword is defined, it is associated with the BABYL
file.  They are not automatically GCed, nor should they be.

In Release 4.5, Reasoning Utility Package 29.0, FEP 18,

The way the system code is written to handle compiler warnings is
generally pretty winning in that it has allowed me to make use
of the whole warning facilities (incl. Edit Compiler Warnings, etc.)
for my own idiosyncratic type of "compilation".  In doing so I discovered
(so far) one minor bug in the system code.  I suggest you redefine
SI:DEBUGGING-INFO as below.  The only change is in the ****** line
in which it checks it it actually has a function spec before it tries
to take the definition.  This is because when this function is called
from SYS:FUNCTION-PARENT, it is already given a function definition, which
in my case is an idiosyncratic list.

    No, you won't lose unless MC is down.  

This is why I have a defcom that sets ZWEI:*MAIL-NETWORK-HOST*.

    This behavior (connecting all over the place) should be a lot better in the next release.

OK, I'll experiment with the namespace method then.  But if it's ANY slower at
all, why should I bother?  By "the next release" I presume you mean Rel 6 and
not another rel 5 version.

    In Release 4.5, Reasoning Utility Package 29.0, FEP 18,
    site configuration 62, on PA Lisp Machine Merlin:

    The way the system code is written to handle compiler warnings is
    generally pretty winning in that it has allowed me to make use
    of the whole warning facilities (incl. Edit Compiler Warnings, etc.)
    for my own idiosyncratic type of "compilation".  In doing so I discovered
    (so far) one minor bug in the system code.  I suggest you redefine
    SI:DEBUGGING-INFO as below.  The only change is in the ****** line
    in which it checks it it actually has a function spec before it tries
    to take the definition.  This is because when this function is called
    from SYS:FUNCTION-PARENT, it is already given a function definition, which
    in my case is an idiosyncratic list.

I needed to do something like this for Prolog, too.  It's not clear what
the policy about the contents of function cells should be, but it does
seem like we need to define such a policy and make sure that all of our
tools can deal with whatever we allow.

(You should see what m-X List Callers does when you put a circular list
in a function cell.)  [That's how I implement REPEAT.]

    (DEFUN DEBUGGING-INFO (FUNCTION)
      (DO () ((NOT (SYMBOLP FUNCTION)))
	(OR (FBOUNDP FUNCTION) (RETURN))	;NIL if undefined

I can't reproduce this.  Since it works for you in a bare world,
something in your environment must be screwing you.  To figure it out,
I'd need (at a minimum) the FEP "Show Status" information, including all
the PCs, and the microcode version you're running.  Probably also the
backtrace info from the FEP debugger.  (If you don't know how to
run the FEP debugger, don't bother yet.)

	As for lack of error checking for misspelled keywords, I sometimes like
	being able to add a new keyword without an excess of interface.  Maybe
	this should only be allowed with a numeric argument to L?  I think this
	should be investigated for 6.0 or 6.1.
    It should query "Really add the new keyword ospys (Y or N)? ". I have been
    screwed by this too many times to count.  Is that an acceptable compromise?
Do like Select Buffer.  Offer completion over the current set of keywords,
complete on comma, beep if it's not in the completion set (but accept it, 
provisionally, for comma).  When Return is typed, beep if there are any not
in the currently known set, say which, and say that c-Return will take them
as they are.
	There should also be a keyword editor so you can delete keywords (after
	verifying none of the loaded files use them).  For the future,
	probably.  There should also be an automatic version which marks all
	unused keywords for deletion.
    Yes.  Currently, you cannot get a keyword out of the KEYWORDS menu
    except by cold boot or the Zmail equivalent thereof, if that.

If you don't have a program called FEP:>Vxx-debug.flod, where xx is your
FEP version number, you should.  See the 5.2 Patch Notes, page 43,
section 10.8.2.  From that you should be able to tell us what function

anything obviously wrong in it?

Subject: conformally displaced arrays
Cc: allegra!mit-eddie!bug-lispm@oz.ARPA, hjb@mit-eddie, kwc@mit-eddie

There are problems with conformally displaced arrays.  These may already
be known, but I couldn't find anything in the documentation specifying
limitations on their use, so I suppose these are bugs.  Here is a simple
demonstration (done with base = 10.) of the more basic problems.

First, array-length gives a misleading answer.

     (setq a (make-array '(10 5)))
 =>  #<ART-Q-10-5 75052027>
     
     (setq b (make-array '(7 4) :displaced-to a :displaced-conformally t))
 =>  #<ART-Q-7-4 75052170>
     
     (array-length b)
 =>  40
     
It apparently multiplies the first dimension of a by the second
dimension of b, so the area whose length is actually returned is not b,
but b plus the portions at the end of each column of a which are not
part of b.

Because of the funny value array-length returns, many other system
functions do the wrong thing.  To show what happens, I'll first fill
array a such that the two indices for each element are the two digits of
that element's value.

     (loop for i below 10 do (loop for j below 5 do (aset (+ (* 10 i) j) a i j)))
 =>  NIL

     (listarray a)
 =>  (0 1 2 3 4 10 11 12 13 14 20 21 22 23 24 30 31 32 33 34 40 41 42 43 44 50 51 52 53 54 60 61 62 63 64 70 71 72 73 74 80 81 82 83 84 90 91 92 93 94) 

Listarray is one function that has trouble with the conformally
displaced array because of the bogus value from array-length.  It conses
up a list as big as array-length instructs, and then fills in only part
of it.  

     (listarray b)
 =>  (0 1 2 3 10 11 12 13 20 21 22 23 30 31 32 33 40 41 42 43 50 51 52 53 60 61 62 63 NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL)

Things get real interesting when we make another, non-displaced, array
with the same dimensions as b, and copy b into it.

     (setq c (make-array '(7 4)))
 =>  #<ART-Q-7-4 75052400>

     (copy-array-contents b c)
 =>  NIL

     (listarray c)
 =>  (0 70 41 12 10 80 51 22 20 90 61 32 30 1 71 42 40 11 81 52 50 21 91 62 60 31 2 72)

This is definitely not the same as (listarray b), which one might
reasonably expect it to be after doing a copy-array-contents between two
arrays with the same dimensions.  What's happening becomes clear if we
unscramble array c by printing its elements in column-major order (the
actual storage order) rather than row-major, as listarray does.

     (loop for j below 4 nconc (loop for i below 7 collect (aref c i j)))
 =>  (0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 1 11 21 31 41 51 61 71 81 91 2 12 22 32 42 52 62 72)

The copy started at the first element of array b (or of array a if you
wish), and proceeded to copy the next (array-length c) elements of array
a into array c, including the parts of array a that aren't even supposed
to be in array b.  Instead of getting the first 7 elements in each of
the first 4 columns of a, we got the first 28 elements of a - all of the
first 2 columns and the first 8 elements of the third.  This assumedly
happens because %1d-aref, as used in copy-array-contents, doesn't know
about conformally displaced arrays.  In fact, it looks like aref is the
only function (besides make-array) that knows about conformally
displaced arrays.

When supdup'ing from a 3600 to a unix-running vax (i.e. prep),after the first screen of data, the first character on each line
starts to disapear as soon as the newline character
is received.

i.e., while the first character if each line is printed,
it is erased when the cursor moves down to the next line.

This happens on both prep and mit-vx.The problem goes away for one screen full if you do a clear.

Try it, you'll see what I mean.

Subject: Gratuitous whitespace in VMS style Dired listing
To: bug-lispm at MIT-OZ

Release 5.2 on Lisp Machine Sid Vicious (3670)

Is there any reason why the VMS style Dired listing takes more space and
displays less information than the ITS style Dired listing?  This is
particularly aggravating when using a narrower than normal (78 char wide)
Zmacs window.  Can you either remove the extra white space, or make
Dired smart about making best use of the available space (something like
the c-X c-B lister)?

I can't reproduce this.  Since it works for you in a bare world,
something in your environment must be screwing you.  To figure it out,
I'd need (at a minimum) the FEP "Show Status" information, including all
the PCs, and the microcode version you're running.  Probably also the
backtrace info from the FEP debugger.  (If you don't know how to
run the FEP debugger, don't bother yet.)

there is no relatus on robot-4, so tell it to skip loading patches.  tell it
"yes" and "proceed" in all the obvious places, going with the default in all
cases, telling it yes to create the package 'ta with default characteristics.
compile the files in the editor in the following order:
	jmhmods

ignoring the other files and ignoring any complaints (they don't matter)

Thanks for the Show Status information; I presume that will enable someone to
determine what your problem is and get it fixed.  I thought I ought to mention
that, at least in older FEP versions, the Show Status command bashes the state

I believe this shows a bug in handling the :but-first clause in defstruct

    (defstruct (justification (:type :list)

When we expand this accessor

    (demons thing)

we get this

    (NTH 3 (THING THING))

which should be

    (NTH 3 (JUSTIFICATION THING))

The problem is in the definition of the accessor subst (the following came
from the eval-when generated by the defstruct form above:

    (SYS:DEFSUBST-WITH-PARENT DEMONS
                              (JUSTIFICATION DEFSTRUCT)
                              (JUSTIFICATION)
      (NTH 3 (JUSTIFICATION JUSTIFICATION)))

It seems like si:expand-subst-definition is substituting for every occurence
of the argument JUSTIFICATION.  Shouldn't the argument be a gensym or
something that doesn't interfere with the but-first function?

Thanks for the report.  In the next major release, this will be fixed, because
the substitution is done more intelligently (it only substitutes for symbols that

around this is to name the defstruct something different.

MIT-Specific 23.0, microcode 320, GC@2, on Lisp Machine Nine:

I was wondering why my LOAD-AND-SAVE-PATCHES was occasionally going off
and grovelling at MC (which is down), so I C-M-Break'ed it, and, well,
have a look at what it's doing.  It's trying to get MC to identify the
host KANSAS for it.  Looks like someone has been kind of brain-damaged
about modifying the site files, or something.

because of the following.  Here is the function GET-SOURCE-FILE-FULL-NAME, which 
is called by DESCRIBE-SYSTEM.

     ;;; Get the source file name, rather than the generic pathname.
     (DEFUN GET-SOURCE-FILE-FULL-NAME (FUNCTION-SPEC &OPTIONAL TYPE &AUX PATHNAME SOURCE-PATHNAME)
       (SETQ PATHNAME (GET-SOURCE-FILE-NAME FUNCTION-SPEC TYPE))
       (COND (PATHNAME
	      (SETQ SOURCE-PATHNAME (SEND PATHNAME ':GET ':QFASL-SOURCE-FILE-UNIQUE-ID))
	      (IF SOURCE-PATHNAME

				    ':NAME (SEND PATHNAME ':NAME)
				    ':CANONICAL-TYPE (SEND SOURCE-PATHNAME ':CANONICAL-TYPE)
				    ':VERSION (SEND SOURCE-PATHNAME ':VERSION))
		PATHNAME))))

Its local var PATHNAME will in this case be (GET-SOURCE-FILE-NAME 'headers 'defsystem),
which returns
     #<LOGICAL-PATHNAME "KWC: DISTRIBUTION; KWC; PUBLIC-SYSTEMS">
The local SOURCE-PATHNAME is then set to this pathname's :QFASL-SOURCE-FILE-UNIQUE-ID
property, which is
     #<UNIX-PATHNAME "SW: //lispm//kwc//rel5//experimental//distribution//public-syste.l">
Then FS:MAKE-PATHNAME is called on a mixture of the components of these two pathnames.
The host - #<LOGICAL-HOST KWC> - comes from the logical pathname, and the version - :UNSPECIFIC -
from the unix-pathname.  And FS:MAKE-PATHNAME of a logical host and an :UNSPECIFIC pathname
gives the above error.

Is this an oversight in GET-SOURCE-FILE-FULL-NAME, or is it the case that a logical-pathname
should never have a unix-pathname for its :QFASL-SOURCE-FILE-UNIQUE-ID?  If the latter, how
could it have ended up with one this time?  In case it might help, here's more information on
the logical pathname:

Lots of mail from MIT comes out with " at " instead of "@".  Apparently
"@" is the new standard and many msgs from MIT come with illegal

the options for *SEND-HEADER-FORMAT* and *REPLY-HEADER-FORMAT* of the
ZMAIL profile generates legal headers.

(DEFINE-ZMAIL-USER-OPTION *SEND-HEADER-FORMAT* ':INCLUDE-PERSONAL :MENU-ALIST

    I C-X C-F while editting "PIG:SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSMGR.SITE]SYLOGIN.COM" and
    it says the default is this file, yet there is no way for me to get the
    machine to complete to this pathname (I want to edit some fields of it).
    hitting COMPLETE or ESCAPE only completes to "PIG:". just typing fields 
    that are different doesn't work either. I try just typing [SYSMGR]
    and it looks for PIG:SYS$DISK:[SYSMGR]SYLOGIN.COM, not 
    PIG:SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSMGR]SYLOGIN.COM. Arrrgggh!

c-m-Y is the command for yanking the displayed default.  In Release 4, c-Y
used to do this, but in Release 5 we decided that c-Y should always yank from
the kill history, regardless of the context.

In Symbolics 3600 System 242.356, Hardcopy 20.10, FEP 22, on Lisp Machine Duane Allman:

Over the past several weeks, logical to physical pathname translation for
files on prep [unix 4.2] has been inconsistent.
Sometimes logial .lisp is translated to .l [the way it has for a long time]
and sometimes .lisp is translated to .lisp .

The system-type of host PREP is currently :UNIX42 .
On  fs:*CANONICAL-TYPES-ALIST* in the 5-2-prime 3600 band,
there is an enry for :UNIX42 but it contains just 1 translation
for some obscure file type.

The :UNIX entry on this list contains the old favorites, .l, .bn, .tx  .

I suspect the oscillation between the two different translations that I mentioned above
has to do with the changing of the system-type between :UNIX and :UNIX42 .

I assume someone changed prep's system-type because they needed to distinguish
between 4.1 and 4.2 versions using just the lisp machine facilities.

Unfortunately, this causes all the old pathname types to default to something different
than they previously were.
Is this desired by someone at MIT?
What is Symbolics policy about unix 4.2 with regard to file extensions?
Does Symbolics claim to support unix 4.2 currently?

The long term solution is probably to use :UNIX as the system-type
and for their to be support for system-version
  [an instance variable in the host flavor? ]

In the short term, it could be put on the plist of the instance for prep.
Including the version number in the system-type is not a good solution
as it doesn't allow things common from 1 version to another to still work.

I would, in general, prefer unix extensions to be the same as Lisp machine extensions.
With 4.2's longer file names, this is now feasable.
The major problems are:
-How to remain compatable with 4.1
-Making sure there is CONSISTENCY throughout.
......
I have many files using the old extensions on prep.
My own personal solution, for the time being, is to eval:

(DEFINE-CANONICAL-TYPE :TEXT "TEXT"
  ((:TENEX :TOPS-20) "TEXT" "TXT")
  ((:UNIX :UNIX42) "TX" "TEXT" "TXT")
  (:VMS "TXT"))

(DEFINE-CANONICAL-TYPE :LISP "LISP"
  ((:TENEX :TOPS-20) "LISP" "LSP")
  (:ITS :UNSPECIFIC)
  ((:UNIX :UNIX42) "L" "LISP")
  (:VMS "LSP"))

(DEFINE-CANONICAL-TYPE :QBIN "QBIN"
  ((:UNIX :UNIX42) "QB" "QBIN")
  (:VMS "QBN"))

(DEFINE-CANONICAL-TYPE :BIN "BIN"
  ((:UNIX :UNIX42) "BN" "BIN")
  (:VMS "BIN"))

(DEFINE-CANONICAL-TYPE :SYSTEM "SYSTEM"
  ((:UNIX :UNIX42) "SY" "SYSTEM")
  (:VMS "SYD"))

(DEFINE-CANONICAL-TYPE :PATCH-SYSTEM-DIRECTORY "PATCH-DIRECTORY"
  ((:UNIX :UNIX42) "SD")
  (:VMS "SPD")
  (:ITS "(PDIR)"))

(DEFINE-CANONICAL-TYPE :PATCH-VERSION-DIRECTORY "PATCH-DIR"
  ((:UNIX :UNIX42) "PD")
  (:VMS "VPD")
  (:ITS "(PDIR)"))

(DEFINE-CANONICAL-TYPE :MSS "MSS"		;for Scribe files, needed by editor
  ((:UNIX :UNIX42) "MSS" "MS"))

(DEFINE-CANONICAL-TYPE :LGP "LGP"
  ((:UNIX :UNIX42) "LG" "LGP")
  (:VMS "LGP"))

This code was lifted from: pig:usrd$[s.r5.io]pathnm.lsp
and all I did was replace :UNIX with (:UNIX :UNIX42) .
It works just fine, and will continue to work
if prep's system type changes between :unix and :unix42  .

If this were to be a more perminent solution, ALL the file types
from pig:usrd$[s.r5.io]pathnm.lsp should be modified, not just the
few most important ones that I grabbed here.

The Symbolics pathname software is monsterous enough that I have probably
missed a few important criteria. 
Therefore, I recognize this message is "Here is the problem."
not "Here is THE solution." .

Doesn't this point out that the functionality which looks for files
of any of the native types that implies the canonical type isn't
used widely enough?  Basically 4.1 files copied to 4.2 retain an
acceptable, but not preferred native type.  I imagine that if
Copy File was used, the native types would have been changed?

Still a problem in the development system.  When Move is installed as
the default for Map Over, it will have to notice that there is a default
move destination defined, and include that in the mouse doc.  It
probably also needs to do the same thing for Reply, Keywords and
Unkeywords, which also have settable defaults.  Thanks for the report.

Now gives you a compiler warning that you are trying to bind a symbol
macro.  Symbol macros don't always behave like variables, and requires
users to know the difference when it counts.  [That's the way it is
today; I'm not trying to justify it, I'm trying to explain the current
situation.]  I don't know if LETF made it into Release 5 or not, but it
is the right thing to use on symbol macros.

No, that's the mouse doc you get for Move.  KMP was complaining that
this info was not transported one level further to what you get for Map
Over when Move becomes the default (L) operation there.

Subject: Blinkers and evaporating storage
To: BUG-LISPM@MIT-OZ

In Symbolics 3600 System 242.356, Hardcopy 20.10,
Experimental Schema 54.0, FEP 24, on GSTAAD:

This isn't really a LISPM bug, since the real bug was in my code, but I
think some improvements could be made to make finding similar bugs a lot
easier.  I'm including the full scenario since it might be useful to
others who might also fall into my trap.

I loaded a file and discovered that my free storage was vanishing at
about 300 words every second.  I hadn't actually run any of the
functions I had loaded so I was more than a little surprised.  Turns out
the space was being consumed by a blinker I had created by defining a
resource with one initial copy.  First lesson: loading files is not
always as benign as one might think.

After determining (or guessing) which blinker it was that was causing
the problem, I pored over my :blink method trying to find the line that
was doing the consing.  I couldn't.  (I don't need to say what a
disaster it was trying to trace various functions called by the :blink
method.  All of this stuff is run every clock interrupt, by the
scheduler.  The machine can get amazingly wedged if you are not
careful.)   

I wrote a little function to that checked the size of dynamic space, and
inserted it at various points in my blink code to find out which line
was generating the garbage.  Again no luck.  To convince myself I was
actually using the space I put the same code around the CATCH-ERROR form
that blinks the blinker in BLINKER-CLOCK-INTERNAL.  Sure enough I was
the culprit.

After a couple of Suan's I finally realized that I was causing an error
inside my :blink method, which was consing a condition object which was
being thrown away by the catch-error.  The code I inserted in my :blink
method to look out for consing was not being run because of the error,
so it looked like I wasn't doing any consing.  I suppose I should have
put that code within an UNWIND-PROTECT, but if I had realized that I
wouldn't have had these problems.

At any rate, I recommend that if a error occurs in the CATCH-ERROR form,
then a message should be sent to the user and the guilty blinker should
be placed on a guilty blinkers list whose elements aren't blinked.  This
ensures that the user finds out about the problem and that the machine
doesn't go off the deep end when you have buggy blinker code.

Just for reference, here's the relevant piece of code:

(DEFUN BLINKER-CLOCK-INTERNAL (SHEET)
  (COND ((AND (SHEET-EXPOSED-P SHEET)
	      (ZEROP (SHEET-DONT-BLINK-BLINKERS-FLAG SHEET)))
	 (DOLIST (BLINKER (SHEET-BLINKER-LIST SHEET))
	   (AND (SELECTQ (BLINKER-VISIBILITY BLINKER)
		  ((NIL :OFF)
		   (BLINKER-PHASE BLINKER))
		  ((T :ON)
		   (NULL (BLINKER-PHASE BLINKER)))
		  (:BLINK
		   (LET ((NEW-TIME (- (BLINKER-TIME-UNTIL-BLINK BLINKER) BLINKER-DELTA-TIME)))
		     (SETF (BLINKER-TIME-UNTIL-BLINK BLINKER) NEW-TIME)
		     ( NEW-TIME 0))))
		(NOT (SHEET-OUTPUT-HELD-P SHEET))
		(LET ((LV (SHEET-LOCK SHEET)))
		  (OR (NULL LV) (LISTP LV)))
		(CATCH-ERROR (BLINK BLINKER) NIL)))
The line above should do something more interesting with buggy blinkers.
	 (AND (EQ SHEET MOUSE-SHEET)
	      (= MOUSE-CURSOR-STATE 1)
	      (= MOUSE-CURSOR-CLOSED-STATE 2)
	      (NEQ WINDOW-OWNING-MOUSE 'STOP)
	      (NOT (SHEET-OUTPUT-HELD-P SHEET))
	      (LET ((LV (SHEET-LOCK SHEET)))
		(OR (NULL LV) (LISTP LV)))
	      (PROGN (INCF *MOUSE-BLINKER-OFF-TIME* BLINKER-DELTA-TIME)
		     (> *MOUSE-BLINKER-OFF-TIME* *MOUSE-BLINKER-WAIT-TIME*))
	      (SETQ MOUSE-CURSOR-STATE MOUSE-CURSOR-CLOSED-STATE
		    PREPARED-SHEET NIL))
	 (DOLIST (S (SHEET-EXPOSED-INFERIORS SHEET))
	   (BLINKER-CLOCK-INTERNAL S)))))

Subject: bug in fill-pointer
To: bug-lispm@MIT-OZ

  There's a bug in the array-has-fill-pointer-p function for
multi-dimensional arrays.  For example,

  (setq a (make-array '(2 3) :fill-pointer 1))
  (array-has-fill-pointer-p a) => NIL
  (array-has-leader-p a) => T
  (fill-pointer a) => 1

  i.e. there's an inconsistency between the array-has-fill-
pointer-p function and the fill-pointer function.  There
is no uniform agreement on whether fill-pointers are
defined for multi-dimensional arrays.

  I was running system 99 when I found this.

It is nice that this function is now documented.  However,
it would be more useful for macro-writing-macro purposes
if it would (optionally) check for the right number of args
(as does Defmacro).  Right now it just takes nils to extend
arglist.

In Symbolics 3600 System 242.356, Hardcopy 20.10, on Lisp Machine Bing Crosby:

SI:WITH-INDENTATION does not work right with :string-out messages.

(si:with-indentation (standard-output 4)
  (terpri)
  (send standard-output ':line-out "foo")
  (send standard-output ':string-out "foo"))

produces

    foo
foo


instead of 

    foo
    foo

Note that the following works just fine.

(si:with-indentation (standard-output 4)
  (terpri)
  (send standard-output ':string-out "foo")
  (terpri)
  (send standard-output ':string-out "foo"))

the indented stream doesn't seem to understand that :line-out does a terpri.

To: BUG-LISPM at MIT-OZ

In Symbolics 3600 System 242.356, Hardcopy 20.10,
Experimental Schema 54.0, FEP 24, on GSTAAD:

At the moment our link to Symbolics is down and thus we are not getting
Arpanet namespace updates from Riverside.  As a consequence, Reagan
thinks that MIT-VAX is a UNIX42 host in the INTERNET and MIT namespaces
but a UNIX bost in the ARPANET namespace.  For some reason, the ARPANET
namespace wins, and (net:parse-host 'vx) gives a host with SYSTEM-TYPE
:UNIX.  This makes it very difficult to read files with long names, like 
"vx:.../lispm-init.lisp".  Fortunately, "vx:.../lispm-init.bin" is just
under the length limitation and can be read.  

My init file then checks to see if vx is a 42 site, and not allows me to
change it locally, from UNIX to UNIX42.  The problem is that since I had
previously opened the file as UNIX file, the pathname-hash-table has a
UNIX pathname in it not a UNIX42 pathname, and all attempts to reference
the file file  (claims that .../lispm-init.lis is not found).  It would
be nice if when the system type of a host is changed, the pathname hash
table were cleared.

For a long time now (like two months) there has been work over here
that has been awaiting the distribution of the Cadr-version of release
5.2...the lab now has a namespace server for the 5.2 system which to
the best of my knowledge runs ok and would serve a cadr running the
proper software.

5.1 is not that software.

I blame myself for not having sent this message off sooner -- I offer
no excuse other than that of "more pressing obligations".  However, it
has been a constant inconvenience not to be able to do any work with
our Music System; it took so long to develop.  We are eagerly awaiting
the version of Release 5 that does not lose with respect to the
namespace issue as the lab is currently set up.

When and where can we obtain the cadr-compatible version of Release 5.2?

In-Reply-To: The message of 6 Dec 84 15:34-EST from Richard E. Zippel <RZ at MIT-MC>
Message-ID: <841210214119.3.MOON@EUPHRATES.SCRC.Symbolics.COM>

Thanks for the report about lack of error messages for errors signalled while
blinking blinkers.  Simply removing the offending CATCH-ERROR would enable the
existing mechanism for handling errors in the scheduler to notify you about
the error, with a backtrace.  This notification is not repeated redundantly
even though the error will keep recurring until you deexpose the window with
the selected blinker.

ACTION: Remove the offending CATCH-ERROR.
        Fix the other bug uncovered by this which I reported separately.

If you want to talk to a TCP/FTP host, you have to be running with
TCP/FTP software on your LispM.  This is now available from Symbolics.
I'm not sure if MIT has ordered it yet.  There are also some beta-test
versions floating around MIT.

    It is nice that this function is now documented.  However,
    it would be more useful for macro-writing-macro purposes
    if it would (optionally) check for the right number of args
    (as does Defmacro).  Right now it just takes nils to extend
    arglist.
		    -CR

In the next release, there will be a version of DESTRUCTURING-BIND with
the same semantics as Common Lisp DEFMACRO.

your fix is correct as stands, and will be incorporated into

Subject: problem with condition-case in a macro that gets used when compiling
To: BUG-LISPM at MIT-OZ

In Symbolics 3600 System 242.356, Hardcopy 20.10, on Lisp Machine Bing Crosby:

If you start in a fresh release 5 system and do a compiler:compile-file on a file containing the following

	  
	  
	  (defmacro foo ()
	    (condition-case ()
		(funcall nil)
	      (error nil)))
	  
	  (defun bar ()
	    (foo))
	  

you get the error state shown below.  The problem seems to be that the
condition-case doesn't get set up right so that it can actually work.
Wrapping the macro foo in an "(eval-when (eval load compile) ...)" does
not help.

Subject: problem with condition-case in a macro that gets used when compiling
To: DICK at MIT-OZ, BUG-LISPM at MIT-OZ
In-Reply-To: The message of 13 Dec 84 09:53-EST from DICK at MIT-OZ

    In Symbolics 3600 System 242.356, Hardcopy 20.10, on Lisp Machine Bing Crosby:

    If you start in a fresh release 5 system and do a compiler:compile-file on a file containing the following

	  
	  
	      (defmacro foo ()
		(condition-case ()
		    (funcall nil)
		  (error nil)))
	  
	      (defun bar ()
		(foo))
	  

    you get the error state shown below.  The problem seems to be that the
    condition-case doesn't get set up right so that it can actually work.
    Wrapping the macro foo in an "(eval-when (eval load compile) ...)" does
    not help.

	It is nice that this function is now documented.  However,

	if it would (optionally) check for the right number of args
	(as does Defmacro).  Right now it just takes nils to extend
	arglist.

    In the next release, there will be a version of DESTRUCTURING-BIND with
    the same semantics as Common Lisp DEFMACRO.

The important part: it will be called SCL:DESTRUCTURING-BIND (and the
Release is numbered 6).  In yet a future release, the Zetalisp version
will exist for compatibility only, if at all.

    Experimental Schema 54.0, FEP 24, on GSTAAD:

    At the moment our link to Symbolics is down and thus we are not getting
    Arpanet namespace updates from Riverside.  As a consequence, Reagan
    thinks that MIT-VAX is a UNIX42 host in the INTERNET and MIT namespaces
    but a UNIX bost in the ARPANET namespace.  For some reason, the ARPANET
    namespace wins, and (net:parse-host 'vx) gives a host with SYSTEM-TYPE
    :UNIX.  This makes it very difficult to read files with long names, like 
    "vx:.../lispm-init.lisp".  Fortunately, "vx:.../lispm-init.bin" is just
    under the length limitation and can be read.  

    My init file then checks to see if vx is a 42 site, and not allows me to
    change it locally, from UNIX to UNIX42.  The problem is that since I had
    previously opened the file as UNIX file, the pathname-hash-table has a
    UNIX pathname in it not a UNIX42 pathname, and all attempts to reference
    the file file  (claims that .../lispm-init.lis is not found).  It would
    be nice if when the system type of a host is changed, the pathname hash
    table were cleared.

Exactly how are you changing the system type?  When the system type of a host
is changed, the pathname hash table -is- cleared.  So either there's something
peculiar about the way you are changing the system type, or my memory of how
this worked in Release 5.2 is incorrect.

	...

	My init file then checks to see if vx is a 42 site, and not allows me to
	change it locally, from UNIX to UNIX42.  The problem is that since I had
	previously opened the file as UNIX file, the pathname-hash-table has a
	UNIX pathname in it not a UNIX42 pathname, and all attempts to reference
	the file file  (claims that .../lispm-init.lis is not found).  It would
	be nice if when the system type of a host is changed, the pathname hash
	table were cleared.

    Exactly how are you changing the system type?  When the system type of a host
    is changed, the pathname hash table -is- cleared.  So either there's something
    peculiar about the way you are changing the system type, or my memory of how
    this worked in Release 5.2 is incorrect.

I change the system type by using the namespace-editor.  I couldn't find
anyplace were the changing the system type cleared the pathname hash
table in our sources, but I probably wasn't looking in the right places.

Yesterday, Dinarte Morais (DRM@MIT-XX) reported a problem with an
send blowing out, referring to some hashing problem in
SYS:RESTART-TRAPPED-CALL (copied in again below).  We have been able to
track this down (we think) to the flavor message handler array growing
as the number of methods grew past 512 (it was around 500, now 535).  We
are "fixing" this by removing some less-than-necessary methods, but

(1) Have you seen this before?
(2) Is someone working on it?
(3) Is there SUPPOSED to be a limit to the number of methods?
(4) Why is this code so crufty?

	    it would be more useful for macro-writing-macro purposes
	    if it would (optionally) check for the right number of args
	    (as does Defmacro).  Right now it just takes nils to extend

	In the next release, there will be a version of DESTRUCTURING-BIND with

    The important part: it will be called SCL:DESTRUCTURING-BIND (and the
    Release is numbered 6).  In yet a future release, the Zetalisp version
    will exist for compatibility only, if at all.

...which is OK, since you can avoid all the error checking by pretending
you are running Interlisp and put &OPTIONAL at the front of every list
and &REST IGNORE at the end.

In Release 5 there are two limits you can come up against.  One is the
number of methods a flavor can have (including inheritence).  This is
somewhere around 504, I think.  This is probably the limit you hit.
This has been fixed for Release 6.  If there is a limit, it is much much
larger.  The other limit is the number of instance variables an instance
can have.  I don't know the value of this limit, if it does happen to be
under 16K.

It means an internal data structure is garbaged.  The data structure in question is the
one used when a message is sent to an instance to find the method to call, and the
part that is garbled is something that is supposed to be a fixnum, probably the
count of entries, or the hashing mask, at the front of the table.

The debugger doesn't bother knowing how to give a reasonable message, and just prints
what the microcode said, because this situation is never supposed to happen.

This problem could be caused by your virtual memory getting clobbered somehow.  In
this case, though, my best guess would be that this is the known bug in Release 5
(and all earlier releases for the 3600) where making a flavor that handles more than
about 500 messages generates a garbage table.  This is fixed in Release 6.  I
don't know of a workaround for Release 5, other than giving your flavor fewer
methods.

In Symbolics 3600 System 242.356, Hardcopy 20.10, on Lisp Machine Bing Crosby:

Please, Please.  Could someone tell Riverside that MIT-HTVAX is now
running Unix 4.2.  I'm loosing due to the filename truncation.  (Bing
ended up talking to Riverside because AP6 is down.  Eventually it talked
to Reagan and got the correct information, but only after much confusion
on my part.)

I'll ask this again: does anybody make sure that all of the namespace
servers agree in their information?  Are the servers supposed to do this
and it's not working?  Or is there one person we should tell when a
system changes type (like when we went to 4.2) and who will make sure
that all namespace servers that might be used by lab machines agree
with each other?

Moon and I answered the message, but the microwave delayed things.  Just
for the record.

    (1) Have you seen this before?

It's already fixed for Release 6.
    (3) Is there SUPPOSED to be a limit to the number of methods?
Not that I know of.
    (4) Why is this code so crufty?
Beats me, batman.  Could be oversight.  It could be that more complex
applications are tickling more bugs.

Sorry, I didn't mean to rush you, just supply more information about the bug.

        (1) Have you seen this before?

    It's already fixed for Release 6.

Relatively useless.  Can you supply a patch for 5.2, or at least point us at
the problem so we can fix it locally?  A 15 minute look through what I
considered the most likely places didn't turn it up, is it ucode?

Subject: Cursor position lossage caused by PCL
To: bug-oz at MIT-OZ
Cc: David at MIT-OZ, bug-lispm at MIT-OZ, bug-pcl at MIT-OZ

I've noticed a cursor-position related bug that may be somehow caused by
PCL routines, using a standard Terminal window on a 3600 (MIT-LENNON).
Sometimes the actual cursor position and the position at which Oz thinks
the cursor is become different, so I can be typing a line to the
exec, and as soon as I type rubout or an editing key like ctrl-R, the
cursor moves to some other location on the screen.

I've noticed this always happens when I use any of the PCL routines I
have defined.  No matter how much typeout occurs as the result of these
commands, the Terminal window behaves as if there was NO output.  For
example, I have a pcl routine called L which displays a directory
listing (NDIR with some extra arguments).  I can type L to the exec, and
get a few lines of output.  Then, if I type ctrl-R, the prompt gets
redisplayed on the line below the line where I typed the L command, not
the line where the new prompt was originally displayed (i.e. below the
typeout of the L command.)  This same sort of problem happens with ANY
pcl function I have.  What could cause this?

	Here is the system definition for UNLESS:

	(DEFMACRO UNLESS (TEST &BODY BODY)
	  `(COND ((NOT ,TEST) (PROGN ,@BODY))))

	Why is the PROGN needed?  This seems to work OK so far as I can tell.

	(DEFMACRO UNLESS+ (TEST &BODY BODY)
	  `(COND ((NOT ,TEST) ,@BODY)))

    I see.  The compiler seems to optimize it in the procedure in which the macro
    is inserted.  Never mind.

    Thanks to Daniel Wiese for pointing this out.

There's another reason.  Consider the current expansion of
	(UNLESS <some-hairy-expression>)
in the current and in your proposal.  Current
	(COND ((NOT <some-hairy-expression>) (PROGN)))
has a value of NIL always (because there isn't anything in the progn.
Your expansion leads to
	(COND ((NOT <some-hairy-expression>)))
which will return the result of (NOT <some-hairy-expression>) always [by
definition of COND] which can be T or NIL.

Therefore, this isn't an optimization issue, but a preservation of
semantics issue.

The problem was fixed for Release 6 by changing the format of these hash tables
to be less brain-damaged.  I don't think there is an easy way to make a compatible
patch that could be loaded into 5.2, since the format was changed.  My guess is that
this will have to stay a known bug until 6.0 comes out.  I could be wrong, perhaps
someone else can find a clever way to patch it.

	    the file file  (claims that .../lispm-init.lis is not found).  It would
	    be nice if when the system type of a host is changed, the pathname hash
	    table were cleared.

	Exactly how are you changing the system type?  When the system type of a host
	is changed, the pathname hash table -is- cleared.  So either there's something
	peculiar about the way you are changing the system type, or my memory of how
	this worked in Release 5.2 is incorrect.

    I change the system type by using the namespace-editor.  I couldn't find
    anyplace were the changing the system type cleared the pathname hash
    table in our sources, but I probably wasn't looking in the right places.

I apologize.  The feature I mentioned is not present in Release 5.2, only in the
newest system, not yet ready for release.

We have been having a number of problems that send the machine into the
cold load stream when it has been idle for times ranging from 1 hr to 10
hrs.  The problems range from errors in wait to null instances.  We can
usually resume  the machine by selecting the "arrest offending process"
option in the debugger, and later unarresting the process with peek.

I realize that this is not a detailed description of the problem.  The
next time it happens I will try to send mail from inside the error.
However, I thought to mention it in case it sounded familiar to someone.

I got an error evaluating the following form:

     '(("SELF"   "PS:<KMP>")))
The equivalent thing happens for the analagous use of FS:SET-LOGICAL-PATHNAME-HOST,
which I guess is preferred in Rel5 (as I guess is obvious from the backtrace).
The following form, on the other hand, works fine:
  (fs:add-logical-pathname-host "KMP" "OZ"
     '(("SELF"   "OZ:PS:<KMP>")))

It should not be looking for a a host in the translations. All the examples in the
documentation show it not needing the host, and it's silly to have to redundantly
specify a host since you've already had to specify it with the PHYSICAL-HOST argument.

:LOGOUT was an undefined function. I think the debugger should watch for that.

Then I typed c-Abort and the file got closed (I assume, since it disappeared

I thought it already was, I typed (FS:CLOSE-ALL-FILES). Oddly, I got an error.

A :COMPILE-LOAD-INIT form should be allowed to have null dependencies.
Right now, one cannot write:

 or (:COMPILE-LOAD-INIT FOO NIL (:fasload ...) (:fasload ...)) 

Instead, one must write

 (:COMPILE-LOAD FOO (:fasload ...) (:fasload ...))

The problem comes that it thinks the former case specifies dependency
on a single module named NIL. I think anyone who wants that should have
to write

 (:COMPILE-LOAD-INIT FOO (NIL) (:fasload ...) (:fasload ...))

This is amusing because a recent change to the MIT system would have
precisely the opposite results: mentioning the host in such a form in the
translations argument would cause an error (device occurs twice), while the
form KMP wanted to use would work.

Isn't something like ":PS:<KMP>" actually the safest thing to use in this
situation ?  (Not a rhetorical question.)

FS:ADD-LOGICAL-PATHNAME-HOST isn't really preferred for what you seem to be
using it; SET-LOGICAL-PATHNAME host is meant for use by large applications
because it ensures that the latest translations get loaded.

In Symbolics 3600 System 242.356, ... on Lisp Machine Frank Sinatra:

I just got a pile of compiler warnings like the following:

  Warning (not associated with any definition)
    Source file truename OZ:OZ:<PA.SOURCE>CONDITIONS.LISP.17 cannot 
    be translated to logical host PA -- QFASL-SOURCE-FILE-UNIQUE-ID will be omitted.

They resulted from having translated "PA: SOURCE;" to "OZ:PS:<PA.SOURCE>" because
the truename of any file that gets opened under that name ends up being
"OZ:OZ:<PA.SOURCE>".

The problem is that what Twenex normally calls PS: is called OZ: on OZ.
Similarly, what used to be called SRC: has been renamed KANSAS: on OZ.
To satisfy people like me, PS: is an alias for OZ: and SRC: is an alias
for KANSAS: ... This means I can write OZ:PS: instead of OZ:OZ: in a lot
of places. Unfortunately, this sometimes causes problems, as with 
back-translation in logical devices.

Couldn't the LispM detect that PS: is the same as OZ: somehow? It's a
system-wide translation. If #<TOPS20-HOST OZ ...> could just maintain an
association list of (("PS" "OZ") ("SRC" "KANSAS") ...), presumably
back-translation could win. Is it possible for it to get that data from
the remote host somehow?

Having done m-X Compiler Warnings, the file defaults offered

Here's a bug in Zmacs line breaking.

(1) Create a buffer and put it in text mode and auto fill mode.

(2) Set the fill column to something relatively small (say 30) so
    you don't have to do too much typing.

(3) Type a tab (I've got zwei:*indent-with-tabs* set to NIL) and then
    COM-SET-FILL-PREFIX (setting the prefix to 8 spaces).

(4) Type ". random" (the problem seems to involve inserting text before punctuation)

(5) Move the point to just before the period (like you were inserting text at the end of
    the previous sentence.

(6) Type "Four score and seven years ago"

Here's what the buffer looks like after I do this.  Notice that "years" and "ago" are
reversed.  Line breaking leaves the point at the wrong place.

    In Symbolics 3600 System 242.356, ... on Lisp Machine Frank Sinatra:

    I just got a pile of compiler warnings like the following:

      Warning (not associated with any definition)
	Source file truename OZ:OZ:<PA.SOURCE>CONDITIONS.LISP.17 cannot 
	be translated to logical host PA -- QFASL-SOURCE-FILE-UNIQUE-ID will be omitted.

    They resulted from having translated "PA: SOURCE;" to "OZ:PS:<PA.SOURCE>" because
    the truename of any file that gets opened under that name ends up being
    "OZ:OZ:<PA.SOURCE>".

    The problem is that what Twenex normally calls PS: is called OZ: on OZ.
    Similarly, what used to be called SRC: has been renamed KANSAS: on OZ.
    To satisfy people like me, PS: is an alias for OZ: and SRC: is an alias
    for KANSAS: ... This means I can write OZ:PS: instead of OZ:OZ: in a lot
    of places. Unfortunately, this sometimes causes problems, as with 
    back-translation in logical devices.

    Couldn't the LispM detect that PS: is the same as OZ: somehow? It's a
    system-wide translation. If #<TOPS20-HOST OZ ...> could just maintain an
    association list of (("PS" "OZ") ("SRC" "KANSAS") ...), presumably
    back-translation could win. Is it possible for it to get that data from
    the remote host somehow?

This problem is starting to strike home!  We renamed a lot of
directories for various reasons and the links are creating the same
truename/expected-name problems.  I don't know what the current state of
it is.

    I had a file open and went into a breakpoint, from which I did (LOGOUT).
    As it happened, PACKAGE was bound to the keyword package and it told me
    :LOGOUT was an undefined function. I think the debugger should watch for that.

This has all been fixed by a more general mechanism in Rel 6.  (For real
fun, evaluate (APROPOS "A"), wait for a **more** break, then hit Suspend
and try to type something.)

    Then I typed c-Abort and the file got closed (I assume, since it disappeared
    from the wholine). Then, just to make sure everything was closed -- even though
    I thought it already was, I typed (FS:CLOSE-ALL-FILES). Oddly, I got an error.

    In Symbolics 3600 System 242.356 ... on Lisp Machine Jimi Hendrix:

    I got an error evaluating the following form:
      (fs:add-logical-pathname-host "KMP" "OZ"
	 '(("SELF"   "PS:<KMP>")))
    The equivalent thing happens for the analagous use of FS:SET-LOGICAL-PATHNAME-HOST,
    which I guess is preferred in Rel5 (as I guess is obvious from the backtrace).
    The following form, on the other hand, works fine:
      (fs:add-logical-pathname-host "KMP" "OZ"
	 '(("SELF"   "OZ:PS:<KMP>")))

    It should not be looking for a a host in the translations. All the examples in the
    documentation show it not needing the host, and it's silly to have to redundantly
    specify a host since you've already had to specify it with the PHYSICAL-HOST argument.

This is an error check to make sure you aren't spreading a logical host
across physical hosts (but see below).  As RPK said, ":PS:<KMP>" is
sufficient in Release 5.

However, we bit the bullet in Release 6 and removed the error check.  We
also renamed the :HOST method to :DEFAULT-HOST of logical pathname
hosts.  This should catch everybody who was misusing logical hosts by
assuming all pathnames translated to the same physical host.

Therefore, logical hosts CAN be spread across physical hosts, and
therefore the physical translation is parsed defaulting against the
>>default<< physical host instead of being parsed with-respect-to the
default physical host.

    This is VERY annoying.  I believe someone else already reported that
    (fs:close-all-files) wouldn't work because this host doesn't handle
    the :close-all-files message.  So, what happened to POINTER that made it
    become a HOST instead of a LISPM-HOST?

    The following happened after selecting PEEK and typing F for
    File-System.

There is no more Pointer here.  I guess that it has not been deleted
from the MIT namespace thoroughly, but I don't know how to fix that.

I don't think you have reported the error message with word-for-word accuracy.
If the message you actually got was "sparse load compare error", I believe
this usually indicates that the hardware is broken.

Try resetting the FEP with the Reset FEP command.  Also try loading a
different world load, in case the world load file is damaged somehow.  If
that doesn't work, call hardware service.

This error usually indicates a bad DP board. Do "Test A-Mem" from the FEP to
see if the A-memory is bad. If so , you need a new DP.

This should return the default pathname for the defaults, but instead it

(FS:DEFAULT-PATHNAME DEFAULTS) when it gets a CR as its first character.
SI:PROMPT-AND-READ-PATHNAME doesn't notice this and tries to send a

In Symbolics 3600 System 242.356, Hardcopy 20.10,
Experimental Xqsim 23.0, FEP 18, on Lisp Machine Sancho Panza:

There are two problems with this function that have been around for a very long
time.  Both occur when I edit a feild (a :sexp or a :string variable for
example) with Mouse-Middle.  Suppose the current value of the feild is NIL and
I happen to click middle instead of left, but want to change it to BAR.  Then
I would type three rubouts, and type BAR, except that after the third rubout the
initial value is restored!?!  Presumably something uses the rubout handler full-rubout
option and then resets the string.  The second problem is that finishing a list with <CR>
results in the next item being cleared and not redisplayed.

To see both of these problems call this function.  The first problem is
prvoked by clicking Middle (not left) on NIL next to FOO and then typing
three rubouts.

The second problem appears by clicking Middle on the list (foo bar baz)
and immediately pressing <CR>.

My third gripe is that the right mouse button doesn't do anything here.
Is it reseverved for anything or is there some reason for this.  I get
pissed off when I press a mouse button on a highlighted item and only
cause the screen to flash because my finger wasn't on the right (i.e. left)
button.  There are other places where only the left button is defined.
If there is only one mouse action in the current location then 
all of the buttons should do it.

(defun test ()
  (let ((foo nil)
	(bar '(foo bar baz))
	(baz 42))
    (declare (special foo bar baz))
    (tv:choose-variable-values      
      '((foo :documentation "The variable Foo is generally a frotz"
	      :sexp)
	(bar :documentation "A bar can include spaces"
	     :sexp)
	(baz :documentation "The answer is" :sexp))

Subject: (DESTRUCTURING-BIND (FOO BAR) FOO ...)
To: BUG-LISPM at MIT-OZ

In Symbolics 3600 System 242.356 ... on Lisp Machine Frank Sinatra:

 (MACROEXPAND '(DESTRUCTURING-BIND (FOO BAR) FOO (LIST FOO BAR)))

  ==> ((LAMBDA (FOO)
	 ((LAMBDA (BAR)
	    (LIST FOO BAR))
	  (CAR (CDR FOO))))
       (CAR FOO))

This is not a correct result. The correct result would have been:

      ((LAMBDA (#:G0001)
	 ((LAMBDA (FOO)
	    ((LAMBDA (BAR)
	       (LIST FOO BAR))
	     (CAR (CDR #:G0001))))
	  (CAR #:G0001)))
       FOO)

which is what would have been produced if (FOO), rather than FOO
was in the source data position.

The problem is that a variable may not safely be repeated in the
destructuring process unless it either doesn't occur in the pattern
or is the last variable to occur in the pattern. eg,

 (MACROEXPAND '(DESTRUCTURING-BIND (BAZ (BAR FOO NIL) NIL) FOO (LIST FOO BAR)))

 ==> ((LAMBDA (BAZ)
	((LAMBDA (BAR)
	   ((LAMBDA (FOO)
	      (LIST FOO BAR))
	    (CAR (CDR (CAR (CDR FOO))))))
	 (CAR (CAR (CDR FOO)))))
      (CAR FOO))

is correct ... just barely.

I assume this problem rarely comes up in practice since DESTRUCTURING-BIND
used to be used mostly internally to DEFMACRO and SI::*MACROARG* is probably
not a popular name for a local variable. Now that DESTRUCTURING-BIND is 
advertised for more general use, though, it's probably worth fixing it to
really work as advertised.

Subject: Some comments about (MAKE-SYSTEM ... :BATCH)
To: BUG-LISPM@MIT-MC.ARPA

In Symbolics 3600 System 242.356 ... on Lisp Machine Bing Crosby:

I have never used :BATCH in MAKE-SYSTEM before, but this seems odd.
I did (MAKE-SYSTEM "PA" :COMPILE :BATCH :NOCONFIRM) and it prompted:

Write compiler warnings to file: (default OZ:PS:<KMP>G0525.CWARNS)

so I typed Return. It then immediately said:

Compiler warnings written to file OZ:PS:<KMP>G0525.CWARNS.
MAKE-SYSTEM finished successfully at 12/23/84 18:26:40.

I was a little suspicious since there are dozens of files in this system
and it hadn't even probed them. Then it prompted:

Write compiler warnings to file: (PA: SOURCE; PROGRAMMER'S APPRENTICE.CWARNS.NEWEST)

to which I again typed Return. This time it started probing files and looks like
it's "working". 

* What was this G0525 nonsense about? The file contains simply:

    -*- Text -*-
    System G0525 made by KMP
    Started  12/23/84 18:26:38
    Finished 12/23/84 18:26:40
    
* I continue to insist that the long name of the system has no business
  getting merged into filenames. The filename suggested the second time
  should have at least been PA: SOURCE; PA.CWARNS.NEWEST

* In fact, I suggest that if BATCH is used, that (for patchable systems) the system
  version be incremented -before- the compilation begins and the CWARNS go to the
  patch directory with a filename corresponding to the system's version. eg,

     PA: PATCH; PA-17.CWARNS.NEWEST

  would be used for version 17 of the system. In general, only one version would
  ever get created unless :NO-INCREMENT-PATCH was being used, in which case the
  .NEWEST would avoid collision.

* I don't like the placement of the colon in:

    Write compiler warnings to file: (default OZ:PS:<KMP>G0525.CWARNS)

  I would prefer:

    Write compiler warnings to file (default OZ:PS:<KMP>G0525.CWARNS):

  or even just:

    Write compiler warnings to file (OZ:PS:<KMP>G0525.CWARNS):

  By the way, seems like (:PROPERTY :BATCH SI:MAKE-SYSTEM-KEYWORD) should 
  be calling PROMPT-AND-READ rather than using READLINE directly. This would
  make Refresh, etc. work better among other things.

Subject: quota exceeded, fixable easily
To: BUG-LISPM at MIT-OZ

In System 98.78, CADR 3.10, ZMail 53.19, MIT-Specific 22.5,
microcode 309, ZM MIT d, on Arthur Dent:


I ran out of quota on EE.
There was a proceed type called clean directory, so I used it.
 It didn't clean anything; although I was trying to write mcstuff.txt.3, it
left files .1 and .2    I expected this since it had typed out onlydeleting 
excess verions >2.   But: I didn't get any warning that anyfiles actually got
deleted (none did) or that none didn't (which is what happened).  There wasn't
any way to delete other cruft easier, without switching to DIRED...

I'm also not convinced that for an ITS that I would necessarily want to have
other files in my DIR deleted "behind my back".  Perhaps in the case that it actually
deletes files, it queries me, but I'm not going to look at the code right now.

There also was no proceed option for EXPUNGE-DIRECTORY, assuming that files actually
got deleted, but not expunged.

When a file host connection dies, for many common situations (ie.
normal user just writing or reading a simple file), one would be
happy starting over with the reading or writing of that same file.
Every once in a while when the following error occurs, the situation is that:
1)  One knows that the host died, or there were some network type problems....
2)  One has good reason to believe that the host is now up
    , or will come back up soon.

I don't seem to recall being able to resume in a manner that says:
  1) GO ahead and forget about my current Network situation with this host
     (ie. resetting it is OK [one may want to have the status of the current
      pending other connections to this host printed out for verification)

  2) ...and when you've done that (possible even waiting some amount of time
     for the host to come up (ala chaos open retry), just restart the major
     file operation.

The "common" symptom that triggered all of this is:

    >>ERROR: Attempt to read file command reply from #<CHAOS

   ...etc.

The problem is that the SI:INDENTING-STREAM handles :READ-CURSORPOS in the
following way:

    (DEFMETHOD (INDENTING-STREAM :READ-CURSORPOS) (&OPTIONAL (UNIT ':CHARACTER))
      (OR (EQ UNIT ':CHARACTER) (FERROR "~S is not a known unit." UNIT))
      (MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND (X Y) (FUNCALL STREAM ':READ-CURSORPOS UNIT)
	(VALUES (- X INDENTATION) Y)))

This confuses :SEND-IF-HANDLES into thinking the thing is handled. There are several
ways around this problem, but the best seems to be to whopperify the :WHICH-OPERATIONS,
:SEND-IF-HANDLES, and :OPERATION-HANDLED-P messages for SI:INDENTING-STREAM so that 
they claim that :READ-CURSORPOS (and whatever else) is not handled when the stream
to which they're forwarding doesn't handle it.

I could even imagine SI:INDENTING-STREAM being built on something like the following,
which could be released for other uses as well:

(DEFFLAVOR UNHANDLED-MESSAGE-MIXIN ((MESSAGE-KEYS-NOT-HANDLED '())) ()
  :SETTABLE-INSTANCE-VARIABLES)
	
(DEFWHOPPER (UNHANDLED-MESSAGE-MIXIN :WHICH-OPERATIONS) ()
  (LET ((MSG-KEYS (CONTINUE-WHOPPER)))
    (DOLIST (MSG-KEY MESSAGE-KEYS-NOT-HANDLED)
      (SETQ MSG-KEYS (REMOVE MSG-KEY MSG-KEYS)))
    MSG-KEYS))

(DEFMETHOD (UNHANDLED-MESSAGE-MIXIN :SEND-IF-HANDLES) (MSG-KEY &REST MSG-ARGS)
  ;; This method may not be needed if :SEND-IF-HANDLES really respects 
  ;; :OPERATION-HANDLED-P and not some more internal data structure.
  (IF (SEND SELF :OPERATION-HANDLED-P MSG-KEY)
      (LEXPR-SEND SELF MSG-KEY MSG-ARGS)))

(DEFMETHOD (UNHANDLED-MESSAGE-MIXIN :OPERATION-HANDLED-P) (MSG-KEY)
  (AND (CONTINUE-WHOPPER) (NOT (MEMQ MSG-KEY MESSAGE-KEYS-NOT-HANDLED))))

(DEFFLAVOR FORWARDING-MESSAGE-MIXIN ((MESSAGE-KEYS-FORWARDED '())
				     (OBJECT-BEING-FORWARDED-TO NIL))
	   (UNHANDLED-MESSAGE-MIXIN)
  :SETTABLE-INSTANCE-VARIABLES)

(DEFMETHOD (FORWARDING-MESSAGE-MIXIN :AFTER :INIT) (&REST IGNORE)
  (SEND SELF :UPDATE-FORWARDING))

(DEFMETHOD (FORWARDING-MESSAGE-MIXIN :UPDATE-FORWARDING) ()
  (SEND SELF :SET-MESSAGE-KEYS-NOT-HANDLED
	(IF FORWARDING-TO
	    (LET ((MSG-KEYS '()))
	      (DOLIST (MSG-KEY MESSAGE-KEYS-FORWARDED)
		(IF (NOT (SEND OBJECT-BEING-FORWARDED-TO :OPERATION-HANDLED-P MSG-KEY))
		    (PUSH MSG-KEY MSG-KEYS)))
	      MSG-KEYS))))

There's some question about :GET-HANDLER-FOR, but I think that should not be
modified. It might want to be documented with SI:VANILLA-FLAVOR that you should
only send a :GET-HANDLER-FOR message to an object if you're sure it handles
the message already.

To: BUG-LISPM at MIT-OZ
Cc: USER-INTERFACE at SCRC-STONY-BROOK

In Symbolics 3600 System 242.356 ... on Lisp Machine Bing Crosby:

Summary: This message tells a story about some problems I just 
	 had with the window system (specifically with various
	 aspects of selection) which I claim would have bothered
	 and/or confused novices.

I did c-M from the debugger and sent a bug message.

I didn't get a chance to read the echo area typeout about where the
message had been sent, so I wanted to go back to the editor that had
sent the mail.

I tried Function S, but that didn't seem to "remember" that I had
just been in a Mail window.

So I did (MAIL T). This got me where I wanted to be, but unfortunately
it cleared the echo area first thing, so I still didn't get to read
what was typed there.

I guess I should have tried the system menu from the mouse and selected
the mail frame that way. Perhaps that would have worked.

In any case, I decided I wanted to be back in Lisp because this Mail
pane didn't have what I wanted. 

I didn't want to type Abort because I thought that would make it think
I wanted to be able to un-Abort later with (MAIL T), which I really
didn't ... and I certainly didn't want to type End, since I figure 
you guys get enough mail from me already without my ending messages 
twice ... so I typed Select L.

This left me in a Lisp talking to the debugger I had started from,
with a display that looked like:

 c-M
  Eval: (mail t)

But Lisp isn't listening, because it has busied itself with the Mail 
window and isn't listening. Now, unlike a similar bug that happens
when you do (INSPECT ...) and re-select the window which you called
Inspect from, you cannot in the case of MAIL type c-Abort to get Lisp's
attention back. If you've INSPECT'd an object, c-Abort does get the
Lisp's attention back.

Personally, I think these two (INSPECT and MAIL) ought to be 
consistent on this business of what is done when you type c-Abort 
on the caller's window (rather than the Inspect or Mail window).
I realize the control structure of these two is different and that
INSPECT is probably winning by a fortunate accident, but I still
think it's right that it does.

I got a system menu, selected the Mail window, and hit Abort and 
the world righted itself. I do not, however, believe that a novice
would necessarily do that. I do believe a novice could easily get
into this sort of situation.

Oops. I noticed a couple of bugs in the code I gave for UNHANDLED-MESSAGE-MIXIN.
I think the code is still intelligible and the fixes should be obvious anyway,

Subject: Proposed new semantics for (LOGIN name :HOST host)
To: BUG-LISPM@MIT-MC.ARPA
Cc: KMP@MIT-MC.ARPA

In Symbolics 3600 System 242.356 ... on Lisp Machine Bing Crosby:

When I do  (LOGIN "KMP" :HOST "OZ")
the namespace server should search its database of users and find the
one who logs in as "KMP" at "OZ" if there is one, and assume that I am
he. I do not expect it to assume that "KMP" at "OZ" is the same as the
namespace user object named "KMP", but I do expect it to infer that.
There is enough info present for it to do so.

The reason I want this is that I want sometimes to get my init file
from some other system than my primary machine. It seems unreasonable
that I should have to do:

  (LOGIN "KMP" :LOAD-INIT-FILE NIL)
  (LOAD "OZ:PS:<KMP>LISPM-INIT")

since that's what it seems to me  (LOGIN "KMP" :HOST "OZ")
was intended to accomplish. 

As things are now, if I later log into "MC", it has to ask me what
name to use. Also, if I send mail, it ends up having confusing
headers like:
 From:  <KMP%MIT-OZ@SCRC-STONY-BROOK.ARPA>
rather than:
 From: Kent M Pitman <KMP@MIT-MC.ARPA>

Personally, I would rather have (LOGIN "KMP" :HOST "OZ") mean
to find the name "KMP" in the user database, find out what he logs
in as on "OZ", then try to log him in as that. I think users
who are not in the database should have to either put themselves
in or say (LOGIN "KMP" :HOST "OZ" :NAME-ON-HOST "KMP") or some
such thing. I know that occassionally people who are not registered
in the namespace will want to log in, but that case is rare and I
see no reason to bother about it.

The problem is slightly complicated in FS:FORCE-USER-TO-LOGIN because
the prompt says type "username or username@host". The username@host 
could be confusing because it looks like net address format and one 
might think the username was supposed to be the one for the host rather
than the one for the namespace. I suggest that if the prompt said
"username or username/host" this confusion wouldn't arise and it would
be ok to interpret the name as the namespace name rather than the name
for the host. In fact, you could say "name, name/host, or name@host"
and let "name"      mean (LOGIN "name")
        "name/host" mean (LOGIN "name" :HOST "host") ;with my new meaning
    and "name@host" mean (LOGIN "name" :HOST "host" :NAME-ON-HOST "name")

	      (CAR #:G0001)))
	   FOO)

    which is what would have been produced if (FOO), rather than FOO
    was in the source data position.

    The problem is that a variable may not safely be repeated in the
    destructuring process unless it either doesn't occur in the pattern
    or is the last variable to occur in the pattern. eg,

     (MACROEXPAND '(DESTRUCTURING-BIND (BAZ (BAR FOO NIL) NIL) FOO (LIST FOO BAR)))

     ==> ((LAMBDA (BAZ)
	    ((LAMBDA (BAR)
	       ((LAMBDA (FOO)
		  (LIST FOO BAR))
		(CAR (CDR (CAR (CDR FOO))))))
	     (CAR (CAR (CDR FOO)))))
	  (CAR FOO))

    is correct ... just barely.

    I assume this problem rarely comes up in practice since DESTRUCTURING-BIND
    used to be used mostly internally to DEFMACRO and SI::*MACROARG* is probably
    not a popular name for a local variable. Now that DESTRUCTURING-BIND is 
    advertised for more general use, though, it's probably worth fixing it to
    really work as advertised.

This is all fixed in release 6 to generate safe code.

In Symbolics 3600 System 242.356 ... on Lisp Machine Frank Sinatra:

When building the PA system in Rel5, I get the following compiler
diagnostic:

  Warnings for file OZ:PS:<PA>LISPM-INIT
    
    For Flavor PA:EDITING-INPUT-PANE
      Unknown special instance variable ZWEI:*LAST-FILE-NAME-TYPED*

The LISPM-INIT file does not define anything. It just constructs the
system, so I'm not sure why it's associated with this file. Perhaps
it's only detected at the time the flavor is instantiated and 
LISPM-INIT is the only file open at the time.

In any case, the meaning of "Unknown special instance variable ..."
is not known to me. 

The variable is an instance variable of the flavor ZWEI:EDITOR
(which is defined in SYS: ZWEI; DEFS). That flavor definition
gives the variable a default initialization and uses the
:SPECIAL-INSTANCE-VARIABLES option to make it special.

I don't understand what this warning is about; the variable seems
quite "known" to me. Can someone explain this? Thanks.

    In Symbolics 3600 System 242.356, Hardcopy 20.10,
    Experimental Xqsim 23.0, FEP 18, on Lisp Machine Sancho Panza:

    I evaluate this form, and then press <CR> at the prompt.  

    (progn (setq *td* (fs:make-pathname-defaults))
	   (prompt-and-read `(:pathname :default ,*td*))) 

    This should return the default pathname for the defaults, but instead it
    blows up.  The problem seems to be that the function READ-PATHNAME which
    is called by SI:PROMPT-AND-READ-PATHNAME returns DEFAULTS, rather than
    (FS:DEFAULT-PATHNAME DEFAULTS) when it gets a CR as its first character.
    SI:PROMPT-AND-READ-PATHNAME doesn't notice this and tries to send a
    message to it, assuming that it really is a pathname like it should be.

This works correctly for me in the Release 6 beta world I'm running.

Many of us have never seen :BATCH work.  When we've tried it, it just
doesn't, so we don't.  To be truthful, there aren't many people who want
to go ahead and fix this because we are gearing up to completely
redesign the DEFSYSTEM/MAKE-SYSTEM system (the 'new system system').  If
everything goes on schedule, this will appear in Release 7.

I'll keep your bug around on the off chance I have the time and enough
barf bags to look into it.

    In Symbolics 3600 Release 5.2, Experimental IP-TCP 15.3, FEP 18, on Lisp Machine Minnie Mouse:

    This seems to be a result of getting the following namespace update

    17:27 It is necessary to change the flavor of namespace object #<LISPM-HOST POINTER 35150620> from FS:LISPM-HOST to NET:HOST.
    This may cause problems in dealing with this object until the next use of
     (SI:FULL-GC :SYSTEM-RELEASE T).

    since NET:HOST doesn't handle this particular message.

    BTW, happens in the 5-2-prime world as well

    >>Error: The object #<HOST POINTER 43214035> received a :OPEN-STREAMS message, which went unclaimed.
	     The rest of the message was ()
    While in the function (:METHOD NET:OBJECT :UNCLAIMED-MESSAGE)  SI:FLAVOR-UNCLAIMED-MESSAGE  SI:INSTANCE-HASH-UNCLAIMED-MESSAGE

...and all similar problems reported recently.

The problem here is that we deleted the host pointer some time ago.  The
release 5.2 namespace system has a bug whereby deletions are sometimes
forgotten.  This means that when you boot your world, it doesn't find
out that Pointer went away.  If Pointer is on FS:*PATHNAME-HOST-LIST*,
as it usually is, this means big trouble.

The quick fix is to splice Pointer's host object out of this list.In the
next release, this should happen automatically.

    From:  <KMP at MIT-OZ>

    In Symbolics 3600 System 242.356 ... on Lisp Machine Bing Crosby:

    Summary: This message tells a story about some problems I just 
	     had with the window system (specifically with various
	     aspects of selection) which I claim would have bothered
	     and/or confused novices.

Yes, these are examples of long-standing misdesign in the window system.

    I did c-M from the debugger and sent a bug message.

    I didn't get a chance to read the echo area typeout about where the
    message had been sent, so I wanted to go back to the editor that had
    sent the mail.

    I tried Function S, but that didn't seem to "remember" that I had
    just been in a Mail window.

After you send the mail, the mail window is gone.  Forever.

    So I did (MAIL T). This got me where I wanted to be, but unfortunately
    it cleared the echo area first thing, so I still didn't get to read
    what was typed there.

This got you into a new window that contained the same text.  It didn't
get back the old window.  By coincidence creating the new window recycled
some bits from the representation of the old window, but that was just
a coincidence and it could have taken bits from some other discarded window.

    I guess I should have tried the system menu from the mouse and selected
    the mail frame that way. Perhaps that would have worked.

Nope.  It's gone.

    In any case, I decided I wanted to be back in Lisp because this Mail
    pane didn't have what I wanted. 

    I didn't want to type Abort because I thought that would make it think
    I wanted to be able to un-Abort later with (MAIL T), which I really
    didn't ... and I certainly didn't want to type End, since I figure 
    you guys get enough mail from me already without my ending messages 
    twice ... so I typed Select L.

    This left me in a Lisp talking to the debugger I had started from,
    with a display that looked like:

     c-M
      Eval: (mail t)

    But Lisp isn't listening, because it has busied itself with the Mail 
    window and isn't listening. 

That's right.  I mean, that's a correct diagnosis of the bad thing that
is happening.

				Now, unlike a similar bug that happens
    when you do (INSPECT ...) and re-select the window which you called
    Inspect from, you cannot in the case of MAIL type c-Abort to get Lisp's
    attention back. If you've INSPECT'd an object, c-Abort does get the
    Lisp's attention back.

    Personally, I think these two (INSPECT and MAIL) ought to be 
    consistent on this business of what is done when you type c-Abort 
    on the caller's window (rather than the Inspect or Mail window).
    I realize the control structure of these two is different and that
    INSPECT is probably winning by a fortunate accident, but I still
    think it's right that it does.

    I got a system menu, selected the Mail window, and hit Abort and 
    the world righted itself. I do not, however, believe that a novice
    would necessarily do that. I do believe a novice could easily get
    into this sort of situation. 

I agree.

My comments above are not intended to defend the current state of affairs,
just to help explain what is happening.

In the next release, once we finish implementing the planned set of commands,
things will be somewhat better (sending mail will start an independent window
with an independent process).

    In Symbolics 3600 System 242.356 ... on Lisp Machine Frank Sinatra:

    When building the PA system in Rel5, I get the following compiler
    diagnostic:

      Warnings for file OZ:PS:<PA>LISPM-INIT
    
	For Flavor PA:EDITING-INPUT-PANE
	  Unknown special instance variable ZWEI:*LAST-FILE-NAME-TYPED*

I believe this is an artifact of the way Release 5.2 was constructed by
patching.  When the system was originally built, there was an instance
variable in ZWEI:EDITOR by that name, but it was removed by a patch
and its storage was recycled for a different instance variable, probably
ZWEI:*CURRENT-YANK-HISTORY*, using the undocumented function
SI:RENAME-INSTANCE-VARIABLE, which evidently has some bugs in it.  It
was done in this kludgey, convoluted way because there were already
existing instances of editors and they needed to switch over to using
the new instance variable.

    The LISPM-INIT file does not define anything. It just constructs the
    system, so I'm not sure why it's associated with this file. Perhaps
    it's only detected at the time the flavor is instantiated and 
    LISPM-INIT is the only file open at the time.

This part is a mystery to me, too.

    In any case, the meaning of "Unknown special instance variable ..."
    is not known to me. 

It's some kind of internal error that you are never "supposed" to see,
I guess.

    The variable is an instance variable of the flavor ZWEI:EDITOR
    (which is defined in SYS: ZWEI; DEFS). That flavor definition
    gives the variable a default initialization and uses the
    :SPECIAL-INSTANCE-VARIABLES option to make it special.

Thanks for reporting this.  As far as I know, you can just ignore the
warning.  It's definitely fixed in the next major release.

Both BONZO and AP6 are up and running (and have been all day, so far as

It costs a notification or two just to do m-X Bug, and I expect it'll cost

I've reformatted them, for visual ease. In fact, if it bothered to
format these notifications at least this well, I'd probably not mind
them so much. One of the things that takes them from the level of
"irritation" to "intense irritation" in my mind is that they are
arranged so uglily.

Subject: Need more flexibility than :BATCH in MAKE-SYSTEM
To: BUG-LISPM at MIT-OZ

In Symbolics 3600 System 242.356, ... on Bing Crosby:

The CWARNS files written by MAKE-SYSTEM's :BATCH option are nice for
some applications but lack a lot for others.

For example, it may be helpful to know in what order MAKE-SYSTEM tried
to compile/load the system. Eg, you can't tell later whether it had
done Compile A, Compile B, Load A, Load B; or Compile A, Load A,
Compile B, Load B ... and this sort of info may be crucial to 
understanding some of the compiler warnings.

Also, if the debugger is entered and some corrective action is taken,
the CWARNS files do not reflect the fact.

Sometimes I want MAKE-SYSTEM to enter the debugger on errors (if I'm
really debugging). Sometimes, though, I'm just trying to see what 
warnings come up and in those cases I wish it would just try to blunder
on past any errors (typing out as much debugging info as possible)
and hope for the best.

I would recommend replacing :BATCH with a set of several options, like
those I've listed below:

  :SAVE-COMPILER-WARNINGS	What :BATCH is now; write a CWARNS file.
  :DRIBBLE			Take a dribble transcript while doing
				 the MAKE-SYSTEM.
  :IGNORE-ERRORS		Try to ignore errors for as long as 
				 possible.

Is it really true that 5.2' is no better than 5.2, or just that it isn't perfect?

    being down every time I do anything network-related.

This is because there is no secondary namespace server for namespace ARPANET
at MIT.  You should create one (but coordinate with a namespace expert in case
creating one is tricky for some reason).  I would suggest making Goldilocks,
Apiary-6, and Reagan secondary servers for ARPANET, since they are all secondary
servers for INTERNET.

Of course, namespace ARPANET is obsolete and ought to go away.  Probably
there is some reason why it can't go away relating to the fragility of
the Rel 5 namespace system, so we have to keep it around for now?
That's just a guess.

	In Symbolics 3600 System 242.356 (>Release-5-2-prime.load) on Bing Crosby:

	If anyone thought the namespace problem was fixed in Rel5.2', I disagree.

    Is it really true that 5.2' is no better than 5.2, or just that it isn't perfect?
    (That's for sure).

	Both BONZO and AP6 are up and running (and have been all day, so far as
	I know), but this silly machine keeps telling me about SCRC-RIVERSIDE
	being down every time I do anything network-related.

    This is because there is no secondary namespace server for namespace ARPANET
    at MIT.  You should create one (but coordinate with a namespace expert in case
    creating one is tricky for some reason).  I would suggest making Goldilocks,
    Apiary-6, and Reagan secondary servers for ARPANET, since they are all secondary
    servers for INTERNET.

    Of course, namespace ARPANET is obsolete and ought to go away.  Probably
    there is some reason why it can't go away relating to the fragility of
    the Rel 5 namespace system, so we have to keep it around for now?
    That's just a guess.

The ARPANET namespace is obsolete and should go away.  I can't make it
go away until all of the release 5 systems are gone from the
MIT/Symbolics networks.  I made MIT systems not be secondaries for it
because, given the unreliability of secondaries in rel 5, I thought
things would be better this way.  I may be wrong.

	    ...

	    My init file then checks to see if vx is a 42 site, and not allows me to
	    change it locally, from UNIX to UNIX42.  The problem is that since I had
	    previously opened the file as UNIX file, the pathname-hash-table has a
	    UNIX pathname in it not a UNIX42 pathname, and all attempts to reference
	    the file file  (claims that .../lispm-init.lis is not found).  It would
	    be nice if when the system type of a host is changed, the pathname hash
	    table were cleared.

	Exactly how are you changing the system type?  When the system type of a host
	is changed, the pathname hash table -is- cleared.  So either there's something
	peculiar about the way you are changing the system type, or my memory of how
	this worked in Release 5.2 is incorrect.

    I change the system type by using the namespace-editor.  I couldn't find
    anyplace were the changing the system type cleared the pathname hash
    table in our sources, but I probably wasn't looking in the right places.

The code for fixing up the pathname hash tables didn't make it into
release 5.  It will be in release 6.

The problem described in these messages happens when a machine running
release 5 tries to use a namespace server running release 6 under
certain unusual conditions.  Even though MIT now runs release 5 on its
namespace servers, you will still see it occasionally if Reagan is down.
In any case, MIT will soon be running release 6 on some of its servers,
so this needs to be fixed.

The patch to fix this problem follows.  This patch should be widely
distributed at MIT so that things don't go to pieces when the release 6
beta-test for the namespace servers starts.

In Symbolics 3600 System 242.356, Hardcopy 20.10,
Experimental Useful 1.0, Color 1.0, FEP 22, on Lisp Machine Buddy Holly:

I would like to save images in a file by first saving an image header,
consisting of an asociation-list (of varying size), and then the image
array itself.  The header contains the size of the array, documentation,
etc.  I also want to be able to read just the header from the file,
without the data.  (I think this precludes the use of
sys:dump-forms-to-file.)

Currently, the a-list is stored/loaded, using a prin1/read operation.
The array is stored/loaded by addressing it as a string (each adjacent 8
bits forms a character) and using a :string-out/:string-in operation.
(I thought this would be more efficient than :tyi's/:tyo's.  Is there a
better way?)  I discovered the file must be a binary file (:characters
nil) for this to work (otherwise, sometimes more than one character
output is read in as a single character into the array string.)

The problem is that the characters are apparently stored using 16 bits,
even though each character represents only 8 bits of array data.  If I
use (:byte-size 8.) option, then the header can't be read (it reads
to end-of-file).  I tried converting the a-list to a string and using
:line-out/:line-in, but these operations are apparently not supported
for a binary file.  (I can't use :string-in to read the a-list because
one does not know its length a priori.)

How can both the a-list and array data be conveniently kept in a single
file?  I can't find an answer in the documentation.  Thanks.

Put the header in the file's attribute list (third argument to
SYS:DUMP-FORMS-TO-FILE) and you can read it back with
FS:PATHNAME-ATTRIBUTE-LIST without reading the rest of the file.
I think this works in 5.2, but haven't tested it.

BUG-LMDOC: This technique ought to be documented together with
SYS:DUMP-FORMS-TO-FILE.  If it was, I presume you would have found it.

This is two bugs, both of which are fixed in the Rel 6 systems.  One bug
is that Pointer has been deleted from the SCRC namespace, but the
deletion didn't propagate correctly to MIT.  The new namespace software
deals better with deletion.  The other bug, lack of robustness in Peek,
is also much better.

Subject: Issues of style in the FQUERY at the end of m-X Reap File in Zmacs
To: BUG-LISPM at MIT-OZ

In Zmacs in Symbolics 3600 System 242.356 ... on Lisp Machine Bing Crosby:

In Rel4, m-X Reap File's confirmation prompt had the options in the order
(Y, E, N, X). I was forever forgetting which "E" was and which "X" was,
but found the placement of "E" right after "Y" and "X" right after "N" to
be a good way to remind myself.

In Rel5, the order is (Y, N, E, X), which I do not find as intuitive.

By the way -- and this is just a general comment about FQUERY, probably
-- I also hate the fact that typing Help at this point will cause
wraparound in an ugly way. If there isn't going to be room for both the
Help and my reply (there almost never is), it should do a carriage
return and start the help documentation on a fresh line. Then it should
reprompt on a fresh line again. I bet most maintainers type Help so seldom
that they forget how ugly the presentation of the Help info is.

Subject: m-X Find File In<Return>, Minibuffer completion, etc
To: BUG-LISPM at MIT-OZ

In Symbolics 3600 System 242.356 ... on Lisp Machine Bing Crosby:

Summary: Specific criticism of choice of name for m-X Find Files in Tag Table.
	 Some general commentary about naming m-X commands.
         More general commentary related to ambiguity in certain completions.
	 Specific criticism of c-X B (Select Buffer).

I would prefer if m-X Find Files In Tag Table
were renamed to   m-X Find All Files in Tag Table

This for two reasons:

* "Find Files" doesn't sound like it will necessarily find all.
  I almost have the feeling I'm going to get a menu of files in a
  Tag Table so I can select a subset.

* This would let "m-X Fi A" be sufficient.
  As it is, even "m-X Find F I" is not sufficient because of collisions
  with m-X Find File In Fundamental Mode.

With regard to this second point, one might imagine a utility could be
developed for use by the implementors which scanned the space of
m-X commands and critiqued the ones which collide in "obnoxious" ways,
so that users who liked to learn and use the "short names" for m-X 
commands could have short "short names" to learn.

I'm also not completely clear that in the case of m-X Find File In<Return>
the completer ought not assume the word "File" is complete since what has
been typed is an exact initial substring of only one of the options. In
the worst case, it should allow c-Return to say that what's there is right.
eg,

  m-X		Extended command:
		Find File In<Return>
		Extended command: (type c-Return to accept "Find File In Fundamental Mode")
		Find File In<C-Return>

This would have the bug that if the user didn't type c-Return, the prompt would
persist and perhaps confuse people ... of course, if you could make it go away 
again if the person didn't immediately type c-Return, that would be better.

In fact, when c-X B (Select Buffer) puts in the addendum about using c-Return to
create new buffers, it doesn't remove it later. So if you type
 c-X B newbuffer<Return>
and it types "(Use c-Return to create it.)" and you type
 <Clear-Input>*B<Escape>
it completes "*Buffer-1*" (assuming *Buffer-1* exists), but the thing about using
c-Return still persists. This is another context in which the "helpful addendum"
in the mode line should disappear if the char it's suggesting you type doesn't
get typed as the next char...

Subject: spelling "fasload" and "synonym"
To: BUG-LISPM at MIT-OZ

In Symbolics 3600 System 242.356, Hardcopy 20.10, FEP 24, on Lisp Machine Keith Moon:

Why does defsystem use the word "FASLOAD"?  How about accepting "LOAD" as a
synonym?

[ Does the next release finally have editor commands for spelling
  correction in it?  (Like PDP10 Emacs has for years.) ]

When sending a bug report, if the editor window that BUG tries
to use when selected was really in a LISP breakpoint rather than at top level, one
doesn't in fact get the 'desired result' of getting a new buffer with text to send the
bug report in.

Subject: Major and Minor Modes in the Editor and File System

In Symbolics 3600 System 242.356 on Lisp Machine Bing Crosby:

It seems somehow like the Major Mode and the Flavor of a buffer should 
be related. In other words, it seems uninituitive that if there is 
something special about a *Tag-Table-1* buffer, that it should show up
in the mode line. Instead, I just see
 ZMACS (Fundamental) *Tag-Table-1*

If I write this out to a file and read it back in, it's not the same
kind of buffer. If Tags were a major mode, writing it out and reading it
back in could (in principle) leave me with the same kind of buffer
rather than my having to do some special-purpose Visit Tag Table
command.  Note that if I write out a Lisp buffer and read it back in, I
get the same kind of buffer.

On a related note, the special aspect of *Mail-1* buffers is not their
structure (sectionization) but their associated command set. It wouldn't
violate anything I've said above if writing/reading a *Mail-1* buffer
didn't put one back in mail (it might just get you back the major mode 
you were in before), but surely a m-X Mail Mode should exist to allow me
to re-enter the mail minor mode on a non-*Mail-N* buffer. eg, I might want
to finish a message I had started a few days ago and had written out a
saved draft of.

There's some question also as to whether a file system should just remember
all the editor modes that were associated with a file when it was written
and the editor should just accurately re-instantiate all the appropriate
state, too. But that's much harder. Most of the comments above are directed
at nearer term possibilities to get people thinking in the right mode about
the relationship between the editor and the file system.

    Why does defsystem use the word "FASLOAD"?  How about accepting "LOAD" as a
    synonym?

:FASLOAD is certainly a poor name.  The problem is that it doesn't do what the LOAD
function does, since it only loads binary files, so calling it :LOAD would be
a poor name, too.

I did (apropos 'fasl) and it found the symbol USER:REMOVE-QFASLS.  I
couldn't figure what such a function could possibly be doing in the USER
package.  It seems to have been defined by SYS:SYS;PATCH-ARTIFACTS, which
is a file with "Package:User" in its property list which is just full of
random system-internals-like crud.  So I'm curious now, just what is the
explanation for this?  What is a "patch artifact"?

To: BUG-LISPM at MIT-OZ

In Symbolics 3600 System 242.356 ... on Lisp Machine Bing Crosby:

Quoted-Ascii Search gotten from c-Q inside Character Search does not find
the page character when I type c-L () because it looks for plus-minus ()
instead. This seems unreasonable since quoted ascii c-L's are translated to
page characters upon read into Zmacs. Ditto for c-J (linefeed), and c-M (return),
and c-I (tab). I like what quoted ascii search does, but I think it should
be consistent with what happens in an editor on an ASCII machine.

How about a proceed option in fs:user-homedir which will allow you to
punt gracefully when your homedir host is down.  At the moment, if you call
user-homedir with your homedir host down, there is no convenient way to
return an innocuous pathname.  Many callers of this function use it to
specify defaults, so you get screwed even if you weren't planning on using
that host.

    I did (apropos 'fasl) and it found the symbol USER:REMOVE-QFASLS.  I
    couldn't figure what such a function could possibly be doing in the USER
    package.  It seems to have been defined by SYS:SYS;PATCH-ARTIFACTS, which
    is a file with "Package:User" in its property list which is just full of
    random system-internals-like crud.  So I'm curious now, just what is the
    explanation for this?  What is a "patch artifact"?

The patch artifact file contains all the definitions that were the
result of patch files, with no source files associated with them.  It
was felt that, since the system had knowledge of these definitions, the
definitions should be made available to the customer.  Merging the
patched sources back into the source files is a painstaking, error-prone
procedure.  The same is apparently true for putting patch stuff into the
artifact file.

Subject: New world load for Symbolics 3600s

In the next few days we will be soon running a beta test version of
Release 6 on our namespace servers. There is a bug in release 5 systems
that cause them to die sometimes when querying release 6 namespace
servers. A patch exists to fix this bug, and a newly patched world load
exists with this patch in it.  The name of the world load is
">Release-5-2-name6.load", and you can band-transfer it from any one of
many 7th floor machines (ELVIS, JIMI, JANIS, BUDDY, MOON, ROBOT1). You
should put this world load on your machine today, and avoid problems
tomorrow. If you want to patch an existing world load to avoid this bug,
load "sys: patch; name6" and disk save the world.

When doing m-X Reap, if I have .PRESS files, it asks if I want to delete them.
It does not clearly indicate to me that it is not keeping any .PRESS files.
In fact, it doesn't even mark the greatest version with a ">" or something.

I tend to think of m-X Reap as something I can safely type lots of spaces to.

I do not believe that it is reasonable to offer to delete all .PRESS files
since the most recent may be quite useful and may not yet have been printed
and may be very expensive (computationally) to recreate.  

I do believe it would be reasonable to offer to delete all but one .PRESS file,
but that is perhaps a matter of taste. I would like a way to better control 
this feature.

Without an example, I don't know exactly what you mean.  The compiler
has undergone some changes for lexical scoping, and I think this may
have fallen out of those changes.  For example,
	(defun foo (a b) (foo a b))
then
	(defun foo (a b c) (foo a b c))
does NOT give a wna error.  This is in something very close to 6.0.

    :FASLOAD is certainly a poor name.  The problem is that it doesn't do what the LOAD

Subject: Wide vs Narrow cursor over tabs
To: BUG-LISPM at MIT-OZ

In Symbolics 3600 System 242.356, Hardcopy 20.10, on Lisp Machine Bing Crosby:

In the rubout handler, if the cursor is on a [wide] tab, the cursor becomes
similarly wide. This doesn't happen in Zwei. The two should be consistent;
I certainly prefer the former behavior.

One might argue that a user isn't supposed to be as conscious of how
whitespace is represented in some modes (eg, consider the behavior of
Rubout on a Tab character when in Lisp Mode), but I wouldn't really buy 
such an argument since c-D (which hacks the char under the cursor in the
standard cursor display mode) does not do the same kind of tabspace
translation as Rubout does.

You might actually adopt some standard style that users could get used to
which prescribed that says that you always enclose examples of things to
type in `` and '' which would be unlikely to conflict much with syntax
people need to use for anything real. In such case, you could write
	Type ``Function 0 S'' to ...
and the boundaries would probably be slightly clearer.

Subject: Request for more featurefulness in Screen Hardcopy mechanism
To: BUG-LISPM at MIT-OZ

In Symbolics 3600 System 242.356, Hardcopy 20.10, on Lisp Machine Bing Crosby:

There need to be some more options to the Function Q family. Here are some
of my thoughts on the subject since I've been recently trying to get useful
screen image hardcopy...

* I would like to be able to say whether the sheet is to be prepared.

* Function c-Q uses TV:SELECTED-WINDOW, but I would also like to be
  able to hardcopy the result of (I wish there were a function that 
  computed this idiom, which I write all the time):

    (DO ((W TV:SELECTED-WINDOW)) ()
      (LET ((SUP (SEND W :SUPERIOR)))
	(IF (OR (NOT SUP) (EQ SUP TV:MOUSE-SHEET)) ;or is it TV:DEFAULT-SCREEN?
	    (RETURN W))))

  Actually, I suspect there are probably applications where I might want to 
  hardcopy any of the things in the hierarchy. Just as Edit Screen has to ask
  which screen to edit. If it could:
   * note the mouse pos
   * present me with a menu of windows all the windows superior to
     the selected window
   * let me pick one
   * de-expose the menu, warping the mouse back to its old pos (in case i didn't
     have the prepare sheet option on and i cared about seeing the mouse in the
     hardcopy in a certain place)
   * wait for blinkers to get redrawn if necessary (eg, if the mouse is on a menu
     item)
   * then (finally) snapshot the window i'd selected in the menu and send it off
     to be hardcopied.

* I would also like the ability to point at a window to be hardcopied, with perhaps
  the same option as I just described (of having it ask which of several windows
  when the window pointed to was ambiguous).

* Another interesting option which came to me just a bit ago, which someone might
  think about some more and decide if is worthwhile might be something which pops
  up the corners like you get in :EDGES-FROM :MOUSE and let you specify a range of
  the screen that you want hardcopied. (This sort of thing can be done later with
  scissors, but it's hard to get the lines as even as would be done with such a
  mechanism.)

	:FASLOAD is certainly a poor name.  The problem is that it doesn't do what the LOAD
	function does, since it only loads binary files, so calling it :LOAD would be
	a poor name, too.

    :LOAD-BINARY
    :LOAD-BIN
    :BINLOAD
    ?
binary is better, bin might imply a direct relationship with
the particular file type "BIN", which is not right.
Of course a better word than "binary" might exist for
"output-of-compilation" or whatever.

    No.  I've managed to get it on the Release 7 goal list, though.

The following bit of (stolen) code gets me a network spelling checker.
I keep it in my init file.
Because it thrashes around in the net, it takes a while (longer the
first time?), on the order of half a minute when things are slow.
It does the trick though.

Subject: Request for more featurefulness in Screen Hardcopy mechanism
In-reply-to: Msg of 9 Jan 1985 00:06-EST from <KMP at MIT-MC>

Along similar lines, suppose you want to generate something to be
hardcopied, but you don't want to draw it on the screen.  For example,
it might be a high resolution picture that is too dense for the
screen, but within the capabilities of the hardcopy device.  However,
you still want access to all the window system's graphics facilities.
The only way I have found to do this is by making something like a
screen and copying about half of the methods from screen, modifying a
few, and then putting a window on that and doing the drawing and
hardcopying.

I would like to see a snapshot feature added to the main window menu (edit

    Yes, the documentation even tells me that this must be a symbol, but I
    couldn't believe that it was really going to force me to intern the name of
    my package in some other package first.

It really does want to be a symbol, but not for the reasons the
documentation leads you to believe.  The code takes the pname and
interns it in the user package (in Release 6 it will do so in the
keyword package to be consistent with the cold load generator), so it
seems silly to force it to be a symbol.  The real reason is to let
(today's) Zwei sectionization deal with the form so m-. will work.

     in mail sending windows.]

That's all well and good, but you should have responded to Alan's
message, not to mine.  I was not talking about an MIT-specific spell
program that uses the network.  I was talking about a FAST general
utility that only conses the strings it offers as replacements if you
didn't give it an already correctly spelled word.  If it doesn't trip
over any misspelled words, I expect to be able to do block-text
correction (e.g., paragraphs) on the order of 1000 words per second and
no consing.  You aren't going to get that out of the network.

In Common Lisp, the COMPILE function does this if given NIL as its first
argument and a lambda expression as its second argument.  This works in
Symbolics Release 6, too.  I guess the feature must have been added
after Release 5 went out or you'd have it already.

Ok.   I did system-control-L left-paren and duplicated the problem twice.
terminal-call (tv:rh-off) solves the problem.
I went to load-patches; but the others were UNREALESED.
I am loading them now, making the system inconsistant!

isn't supposed to send option values equal to the default.

When I run the login command and it loads the login file,
standard-input is bound to #LMFS-CHAR-INPUT-OPENING.

What is the correct way to do the read from the LISP LISTENER ?

Another problem I have is that sometimes, not after a clean boot, though,
(login 'rene) will invoke the login function itself, which prompts
me with the usual : type your name to login, use name T for not loading
you init file  (or something like that) !!!

We are running release 5.2 and we haven't received the source yet.

    standard-input is bound to #LMFS-CHAR-INPUT-OPENING.

    What is the correct way to do the read from the LISP LISTENER ?

Functions such as READ and READLINE take their input by default from the
stream called STANDARD-INPUT, which is bound to the login file when that file
is being read, as you observed.  The stream QUERY-IO is always supposed to be
bound to a stream you can ask a question from, and certain other functions,
such as PROMPT-AND-READ, FQUERY, and Y-OR-N-P, default to that stream.

(READ QUERY-IO) will read from the Lisp listener when your login file is being
loaded.  I better way of reading a Lisp expression is to say

    (PROMPT-AND-READ :EXPRESSION)

or, if you are reading a number,

    (PROMPT-AND-READ :NUMBER)

For more information, look up the variable QUERY-IO and the function
PROMPT-AND-READ in the documentation set.

	The following seems to fix the bug nicely.

	(defmethod (si:indenting-stream :line-out) (&rest args)
	  (lexpr-funcall-self ':string-out args)
	  (funcall-self ':tyo #\cr))
    UUUUUCCCCCH!  Lesson Uno in "Multiple Self and the Send-As Problem"
    (new recording group?)!  si:indenting-stream thinks it's cool
    to forward to its "inner self" anything it doesn't understand,
    including :LINE-OUT.  Modulo a new message-passing theory,
    your fix is correct as stands, and will be incorporated into
    a future release.
Said future release happens to be Release 6.0 (patch 269.220).

Points of style:
 * (lexpr-)funcall-self exist for compatibility.  In a previous
   implementation of flavors, they were faster than the (lexpr-)funcall
   of SELF equivalents.  This is no longer true; everything is equally
   fast.  Therefore, you should be using (LEXPR-)FUNCALL SELF, or in
   this case, since you know it is an instance, (LEXPR-)SEND SELF.
 * There is an implicit assumption in your code that the ARGS for
   :LINE-OUT are the same as those for :STRING-OUT.  This happens to be
   true, but it bothered me enough that I made the arguments explicit.

I've been trying to get the debugger to look at a particular stack
group within a process.  I see that DBG:FORCE-SG-INTO-DEBUGGER is
not defined (at least not on a 3600).  Has anyone written such a 
function?  I've looked at (:METHOD SI:PROCESS :INTERRUPT) and it 
looks a little hairy to reproduce for specific stack groups.

Yes, the feature of giving a stack group to the DBG function has not
been implemented on the 3600.  I thought it was too difficult, and there
hasn't been much call for it so far.  If you really need the feature,
send a note to HOSS at SCRC-STONY-BROOK and they will pass it on the
people who set priorities for software development.

Unforutately, now the only good stuff in it was what I was in the process of
typing just now.    

Debugging-Suggestion:   If there are bugs that are know to exist potentially in a system;
or there is "well-known" useful debugging information associated with a
certain class of error; perhaps control-M in the debugger (or w/ an argument)
could include or offer to include that debugging information in the debugging report.

Anyway, I really can't give any other information that might be relevent that
isn't in this too long backtrace.

3> Is there any way to force lisp to use a telnet connexion, even when

In-reply-to: Msg of 12 Jan 1985 22:15-EST from David Vinayak Wallace <Gumby>

I was going to try this out on a 3600 so I could guarentee what I said was
true.  But my stack got big, and am going to sleep soon.  Therefore, I will
only respond with statements that I know are true:

    In Symbolics 3600 System 242.356, Hardcopy 20.10, FEP 22, on Lisp Machine Sid Vicious:

    1> Typing network-help shouldn't gubbish the display.

I'm not sure what this means/does.  I'm willing to rephrase this to
say that your screen bits (or any other mechanism that won't trash
your display) should be saved for you in general when you use the
network key.  I've been screwed by this in 240+ and 98+.

    3> Is there any way to force lisp to use a telnet connexion, even when
       the remote machine has a supdup server?

    david

I know you know this david, but perhaps this will help:
  The goal is to connect to a target machine utilizing the TELNET protocol.
One used to be able to force this to occur via the following kludge:
(this works in 4.0)
      for ARPA hosts  (I checked this)
  Connect to host: HOST/27    or   HOST/TELNET   seems to work.
    is of course an altmode
                            MCHOST/27  or MCHOST/TELNET also seemed to work.

  However, MC and XX have a chaos/arpa TCP server.   Contact name TCP, but
it looks at its arguments and it does the namespacing.

 Ie:  XXTCP_OFFICIAL-HOST-NAME-NO-DOMAIN_27   as another kludge.
   
   the variable neti:*chaos-arpa-contact-name* used to be advertised,
as were user callable TELNET and SUPDUP functions.

No representation is made that the above is true and consistent with
Release 5.  Just hope that some of this is applicable.

I also was trying to say what a normal user could do.   Certainly doing
a (breakon an internal function and SETFing the local variables is to
gross a crock (and the only reason I'm suggesting this is because this
is the silly way I do this sort of thing, and was hoping for a better
paradigm).

I realized that my previous message may not have been entirely
understandable for everyone.  Here were my main points:

1)  One shouldn't lose the information in a supdup window 
    when the <network> key is used or some other common,
    action is performed which affects the screen significantly.

2)  A normal user, while not having to fully understand the implementation
    of it all, should EASILY be able to choose what kind of protocol
    should be used, eg. SUPDUP, TELNET etc.

3)  I wanted to respond to the question; without giving misleading information
    because I'm not an official representative of Symbolics, Inc.

I once had a patch to emulate a VT52.  I haven't tried it since
pre-release-5, and I doubt it would work, but the code's in

Subject: Much errors in debugger
To: BUG-LISPM at MIT-OZ

In System 98.80, CADR 3.10, ZMail 53.19, MIT-Specific 22.5,
microcode 309, ZM MIT d, on Arthur Dent:

Several problems happened here.  This last one prompted me to actually send the message.

1) My file job on EE had died; and I wanted to re-compile my file.  But
since I had warmbooted previously, it lost my username and password.

This was because I ended up being thrown in process-lock Lock with no hope
of continuing while trying to validate host connection.

I called (fs:force-user-to-login ...) on myself.  My fs:user-id was "Hdt" and
enter... (I forget the exact text): and I typed s.hdt <new-password> It immediately
reprompted me with the same thing without even checking my password with the file server.

Eventually,...

Typing (qc-file "ee:ps:<s.hdt>lispm-init.lisp") Came back with Error: Not logged in!
  New pathname to retry: <....defaults> or <end> to enter deugger.   Apparently
there isn't a clear cut understanding that not being logged in really is significantly
distinct from a normal file/chaos error, and should be handled differently.

Robustness: In addition, the exact same restart messages for Return to Breakpoint BREAK.
still exist bound to different keys.

The events leading up to this specifc error are still visible in my lispm listener:

(qc-file "...")  --> Pathname to use: (default is EE:PS:<S.HDT>LISPM-INIT.LISP.0 or <End>
to enter debugger.  I typed carraige return, and it responded with 
Not logged in for EE:PS:<S.HDT>LISPM-INIT.LISP.0
Pathname to use instead (default EE:PS:<S.HDT>LISPM-INIT.LISP.0): [I typed this time.]

>>Error: Not logged in for EE:PS:<S.HDT>LISPM-INIT.LISP.0
 EE:PS:<S.HDT>LISPM-INIT.LISP.0

S-a  proceeds, trying the FILE operation again.
S-b  proceeds, reading a new filename and using that again.
s-c  Return to BREAK BREAK.
s-d  Return to BREAK BREAK.
s-e  Return to top level for lisp listener 1.
s-f  Restart process Initial process.
s-g  Arrest and restart process Initial process.

I typed super-b:  (I don't give up do I?)
It prompted for file name with same default.  I typed carraige return and got this:

Please ignore my password which you will find a backtrace of an earlier bug report.  AT least it isn't my MULTICS password.  (Please note the this really IS a bug REPORT.  It also seems to be a hard issue of how to best solve this.

In Release 4.0, Experimental Macsyma 6.13, site configuration 12, on Zarniwoop:

On ARTHUR I just ran out of virtual memory.  I saw it coming; I had
500K left with my ZMAIL up.  I did a sort alphabetically and got pushed into the
scheduler.    

I'm looking even more forward to the garbage collection talk tomorrow.


But for those machines (including this one) for which it isn't practical to do hardware mods,
I propose that some of virtual memory be preallocated as "garbage" which can easily be 
freed by whatever mechanism currently exists.   This is so that I can call a function
like (zwei:save-all-files)  if I'm stupid enough to run out.  My last warning showed
me with over 200K.   By the way, (gc-status) cons up roughtly 150 words in both
Rel 4 and System 98.  Perhaps this can't be helped, but any suggestions on how I can
find out how much virtual memory is left by doing the least amount of consing possible?

    1> Typing network-help shouldn't gubbish the display.

Fixed in release 6.

    2> Is there and way to get the telnet mode to emulate some terminal more
       widely-supported than the imlac?

In release 6, it will support a subset of VT100 and AAA.

    3> Is there any way to force lisp to use a telnet connexion, even when
       the remote machine has a supdup server?

No, not yet.

You could make a local-only modification to the namespace information
for the host, deleting the line that says that it supports SUPDUP.

    In Symbolics 3600 System 242.356, Hardcopy 20.10, FEP 22, on Lisp Machine Sid Vicious:

    Is there a case in which (unwind-protect <one-form>) is different from
    <one-form>?  If not, the compiler should (and doesn't currently)
    optimize this.  I have a macro that produces these one-arg
    unwind-protects. 

As far as I can tell, they are semantically the same.  The optimization
is not done in Release 6.0minus-epsilon, and I doubt we should toss it
in "at the last minute."  Until Release 7, or maybe 6.1, you will have
to make your macro a bit smarter, or you can hack
    (defun (unwind-protect phase-1) (body destination)
to have
      (if (null handler-body)
	  (phase-1 protected-form destination)
	...)
      ...)
in the obvious place.  Make sure you redo this when you get Release 6;
this function was changed somehow when lexical scoping was introduced.

In Symbolics 3600 System 242.356, Hardcopy 20.10, FEP 24, on Lisp Machine John Lennon:

This should work.  You should also have a digestify-buffer command
(which keeps all the references stuff for following conversations).

    In Release 5.1, on Lisp Machine Four (LM-2):

    >>Error: The host PREP (of system type UNIX42) cannot be a file computer.
    While in the function FS:ADD-FILE-COMPUTER  FS:GET-PATHNAME-HOST  FS:PARSE-PATHNAME-FIND-COLON

The canned answer to this is "use 5.2", which I realize doesn't help you
much.  Due to difficulties dealing with ancient LM-2's, it is not clear
when we will get a LM-2 5.2 out.  Try this:

(defprop :unix42 fs:unix-host net:host-type-flavor)

    In Symbolics 3600 System 242.356, Hardcopy 20.10, FEP 18, on Lisp Machine Frank Sinatra:

    (defun foo (x &rest y) x)
    FOO
    (foo 1 2)
    1
    (defun foo (x &rest y) y)

You can't return an &REST argument, since it's stack-consed.  If you
want to return it (or stash it somewhere), COPYLIST it first.

    I was going to try this out on a 3600 so I could guarentee what I said was
    true.  But my stack got big, and am going to sleep soon.  Therefore, I will
    only respond with statements that I know are true:

Last I knew, you (HDT) are not on the Symbolics payrole.  Your reply
shows that you do NOT know what is true, or what is possible, or what is

    In Symbolics 3600 System 242.356, Hardcopy 20.10, FEP 22, on Lisp Machine Sid Vicious:

Maybe I can supply real answers.

    1> Typing network-help shouldn't gubbish the display.

It doesn't in Release 6.  Interaction with the user (via the <Network>
key) happens on a typeout pane that does not interfer with the bits of
the virtual terminal.

Bug to fix: <Return> should be a command which exits the command prompt.
I.e., do nothing.  Ah, rubout does that, but rubout isn't in the Help
list.

    2> Is there and way to get the telnet mode to emulate some terminal more
       widely-supported than the imlac?

It is supposed to emulate an AAA to some degree.  Does it not do that in
Release 5, or is it broken in ways you can be specific about.

    3> Is there any way to force lisp to use a telnet connexion, even when
       the remote machine has a supdup server?

Not in Release 5 or 6.  For now, you have to edit the hosts namespace
object, locally, and remove the supdup service.  In some future release,
the Terminal program and the command processor will know about each
other and let you have the Release 4 functionality and more without the
silly JCL style BS.

    In Symbolics 3600 System 242.356, Hardcopy 20.10, FEP 18, on Lisp Machine Frank Sinatra:

    (defun foo (x &rest y) x)
    FOO
    (foo 1 2)
    1
    (defun foo (x &rest y) y)
    FOO
    (foo 1 2)

&rest arguments are consed on the stack.  You may not return them or store
pointers to them in permanent list structure.  
   (defun foo (x &rest y) (copylist y))
is the "right" thing for this test case.

This general set of deficiencies is well understood; it is an optimization
to get reasonable speed in calling sequences.  It will probably be
fixed in a future release.

        I was going to try this out on a 3600 so I could guarentee what I said was
        true.  But my stack got big, and am going to sleep soon.  Therefore, I will
        only respond with statements that I know are true:

    Last I knew, you (HDT) are not on the Symbolics payrole.  Your reply
    shows that you do NOT know what is true, or what is possible, or what is
    planned.  Please refrain from attempting to represent Symbolics.

Ideally I would have prefered to have received this as a private message, and had
all of this sent out if it needed to.  But let me get some things clear:

1)  I will state that I am not directly on the Symbolics payroll, but it is in fact
    false that I do not receive financial benefit when Symbolics's fortunes ''improve''.
    However, I indeed am concerened about a potential "conflict of interest screw".

	2) Your reply shows that you do NOT know what is true,

i) I admit that I don't know what is the current state of the world w. r. t. this
specific problem in the current Symbolics System.

     or what is possible,
(ii) By possible do you mean what is physically capable of being of acheived, or realistic
for the next release...(see next line)

while I reiterate by reply (# i); 

   or what is possible, 

I still believe that my message was accurate as of Symbolics release 4.0. 
If you are willing to conced this point, I believe that deals with your
argument (2 a)

or what is planned. 

   Sure.

   Please refrain from attempting to represent Symbolics.

I do not wish to claim to represent Symbolics.  I do feel that I am legally
entitled to make correct statements about a particular issue on bug-lispm@OZ.

I simply wanted to try to tell GUMBY something that I thought would work.
I ideally wanted to check it on a 3600; UNFORTUNATELY I'm not sure of what
you would consider the legal issues involved in my using one.  Maybe I shouldn't
have sent to message to bug-lispm, but if I had included references to Symbolics in
a private message, you might later try to claim a kind of fraudulent misreprentation.
Hopefully, this is not desired.   I thought I had disclaimed my message; I'm not
sure its worth my time to dig it out now.

This is a bug that it ignores lines in the FSPT which don't end in a
newline.  It will be fixed in the real release 6.   In the mean time,
the fix is to put a newline at the end of the FSPT.

Subject: TV:MARGIN-CHOICE-MIXIN loses with fonts bigger than CPTFONT
To: BUG-LISPM at MIT-OZ

In Symbolics 3600 System 242.356, CREF 10.0x, ... on Keith Moon:

TV:MARGIN-CHOICE-MIXIN doesn't work when the font map for the window is
JESS14 --- or perhaps when it is anything bigger than CPTFONT. I didn't
do the leg work to distinguish the two cases, but suspect it's just not
looking at the font and allocating too small an area to draw the menu
item in.

The easy fix might be to force the choices into CPTFONT ... closer to
right would be to have it use the window's font map.  Still better would
be to let me specify a font for the margin choices which is different
than the font used by the rest of the window.

Here's a test situation:

(defflavor test-window () (tv:margin-choice-mixin tv:window)
  (:default-init-plist
     :margin-choices '(("Test 1"      nil test-1   nil nil)
		       ("Test 2"      nil test-2   nil nil))
   ; :font-map '(fonts:jess14)
     :blinker-p nil
     :deexposed-typeout-action :permit
     :save-bits t
     :borders nil))

(setq x (tv:make-window 'test-window
			:edges-from :mouse
			:expose-p t))

This works fine if the semicolon in front of the :FONT-MAP specification is
left in place, but blows up if I remove the semicolon so the font map will
get specified. 

Here's the stack trace...

When using this command, when does the 3600 decide to load the

that the just compiled code is completely useless and need not be

    (prompt-and-read :past-date "What part of history would you like to travel to?")
    What part of history would you like to travel to?Tomorrow
    23774360520
    :RELATIVE
    NIL

The Release 6 Sage database for this says :PAST-DATE is used to
disambiguate times that could be past or future.  It says nothing about
FORCING the time to be in the past.

Besides, isn't 'tomorrow' is history waiting to happen?

    When using this command, when does the 3600 decide to load the
    compiled code and when does it decide that somehow the programmer is a
    complete cretin and decide that it is for the betterment of the world
    that the just compiled code is completely useless and need not be
    loaded.

Please include a standard bug header.  I will assume this is using
Symbolics Release 5.2 and that the command you mention is the Zwei m-X
Compile File command.

Compile File never loads.  It will notice if you are compiling a file
corresponds to a buffer and offers to save the buffer if it is modified.

Load File checks for a modified buffer as well, and if it notices that
the .BIN file is older than the .LISP file, it offers to compile the
file first.  If there are any compiler warnings, which should appear in
the typeout window, it will then ask if you really want to load the file
despite the compiler warnings.

This doesn't happen in the un-gc'd system, and doesn't happen at top level.

(I guess you guys intend to enforce that thing about system-release t only

Which subspecies thereof?
								 I earlier did a make-system
    of the same thing, so this is probably not repeatable.  I doubt it's related, but the EGC

Care to say anthing about the previous make-system?  DId it succeed?
Did it fail in some way?  Was there some error listing a directory
(this sounds like a bug I fixed many months ago, of this nature.)

things like this have been reinitialized at boot time so that it's possible to have
printer types other than the ones in the standard system without resorting to doing
things like adding an initialization myself that gets it right?

	All I did was a make-system.  Goldy is also running Rel 6.   
    Which subspecies thereof?

The two world loads were exact clones of each other.

								     I earlier did a make-system
	of the same thing, so this is probably not repeatable.  I doubt it's related, but the EGC
	was on.
    Care to say anthing about the previous make-system?  DId it succeed?

It succeeded, and then failed on the GC when it ran out of memory (I think I can
skip the GC stuff now anyways, since the EGC seems to catch all the load
consing).

The following make-system succeeded, and the numerous ones involved in the compiling
process also suceeded, so it's not at all a common thing.

    Did it fail in some way?  Was there some error listing a directory
    (this sounds like a bug I fixed many months ago, of this nature.)

In TELNET, you do <Network>-X and then pick it out of the menu.  In
SUPDUP, it is irrelevant, since you are using the SUPDUP virtual
terminal protocol.

    T

    It should be finding Goldy.

I figured out the reason for this, and it was because having manually
set si:*screen-hardcopy-device* to the Versatec-printer object
returned by (neti:find-object-named :printer :papa-bear), Goldy's
property list still had the random-printer object.  After poking
around for a while, (no easy problem with only Rel 5 sources) I was
able to manage to find a way that fixes these two things:

(defun frob-cached-versatec-objects ()
  (let* ((printer si:*screen-hardcopy-device*)
	 (spoolers (si:printer-spooler-hosts printer)))
    (when (eq (send printer :get :type) :versatec)
      (setq printer
	    (setq si:*screen-hardcopy-device*
		  (neti:find-object-named
		    :printer
		    (intern (send (send printer :name) :string) 'keyword))))
      (dolist (spooler spoolers)
	(send spooler :check-validity nil t)))))

(add-initialization "Frob Versatecs" '(frob-cached-versatec-objects)
'(:now :warm))

It was late at night, so it may be doing a little more than it needed
to on the find-object-named stuff, but I had thought I remembered it
finding random-printer with the string but not with the keyword.

    So why does screen hardcopy insist on using the "Random Printer" object?  Shouldn't

    printer types other than the ones in the standard system without resorting to doing

There are two problems here.  First, FIND-OBJECT-NAMED will do the wrong
thing if it is given a symbol for a non-globally-named object.  It
always creates a new object which is improperly interned.  You should
say (NET:FIND-OBJECT-NAMED :PRINTER "PAPA-BEAR").  This is fixed in the
real release 6.

I assume that your local code adds a SI:PRINTER-TYPE-FLAVOR property to
:VERSATEC.  Whenever you do something like that, you have to call
(NETI:REDEFINE-OBJECTS-OF-CLASS :PRINTER) to make sure that all of the

	(si:printer-spooler-hosts si:*screen-hardcopy-device*) =>

	T

	It should be finding Goldy.

    I figured out the reason for this, and it was because having manually
    set si:*screen-hardcopy-device* to the Versatec-printer object
    returned by (neti:find-object-named :printer :papa-bear), Goldy's
    property list still had the random-printer object.  After poking
    around for a while, (no easy problem with only Rel 5 sources) I was
    able to manage to find a way that fixes these two things:

    (defun frob-cached-versatec-objects ()
      (let* ((printer si:*screen-hardcopy-device*)
	     (spoolers (si:printer-spooler-hosts printer)))
	(when (eq (send printer :get :type) :versatec)
	  (setq printer
		(setq si:*screen-hardcopy-device*
		      (neti:find-object-named
			:printer
			(intern (send (send printer :name) :string) 'keyword))))
	  (dolist (spooler spoolers)
	    (send spooler :check-validity nil t)))))

    (add-initialization "Frob Versatecs" '(frob-cached-versatec-objects)
    '(:now :warm))

    It was late at night, so it may be doing a little more than it needed
    to on the find-object-named stuff, but I had thought I remembered it
    finding random-printer with the string but not with the keyword.

I responded to the, but I thought I'd clarify it.  You get back a bogus
object by passing a symbol to FIND-OBJECT-NAMED.  The RANDOM-PRINTER
object is the correct one.  What you want is to call
(NETI:REDEFINE-OBJECTS-OF-TYPE :PRINTER) to get the flavors right.  It
will change PAPA-BEAR to a VERSATEC-PRINTER.

To: BUG-LISPM at MIT-OZ

In Symbolics 3600 System 242.356, Hardcopy 20.10, FEP 18, on TELLURIDE:

When I tried to save out this buffer into a file on my directory, <TOM>, I
got a msg of the variety "Enter username or type <RETURN> for anonymous" . I
typed <RETURN>, and got this error for my directory. So I aborted out of the
error, and tried again, expecting the "Enter username etc." again. Instead I
instantly got this error again. So I tried to save out into someone else's
directory, but again got this error.

Great loss. One mistake, and I'm doomed forever.

    I responded to the, but I thought I'd clarify it.  You get back a bogus

Thansk, It worked, except for the small matter of the function name
being NETI:REDEFINE-OBJECTS-OF-CLASS instead of TYPE.

No, there are various things you can do.  The most extreme is cold
booting!!  More realistic things are
	(send (dbg:arg 0) :reset)
to reset the host unit.  Or
	(fs:file-login nil)
to logout all current file connections so it will login next time.  Or
	(neti:reset) (neti:enable)
to punch the network in the nose.  You can also go into peek and clobber
the control connection from F(ile system) mode.

        In Symbolics 3600 System 242.356, Hardcopy 20.10, FEP 18, on TELLURIDE:

        When I tried to save out this buffer into a file on my directory, <TOM>, I
        got a msg of the variety "Enter username or type <RETURN> for anonymous" . I
        typed <RETURN>, and got this error for my directory. So I aborted out of the
        error, and tried again, expecting the "Enter username etc." again. Instead I
        instantly got this error again. So I tried to save out into someone else's
        directory, but again got this error.

        Great loss. One mistake, and I'm doomed forever.

    No, there are various things you can do.  The most extreme is cold
    booting!!  More realistic things are
    	(send (dbg:arg 0) :reset)
    to reset the host unit.  Or
    	(fs:file-login nil)
    to logout all current file connections so it will login next time.  Or
    	(neti:reset) (neti:enable)
    to punch the network in the nose.  You can also go into peek and clobber
    the control connection from F(ile system) mode.

Maybe one or more of these fixes should be a resume option?  It

Look at the end of the message.  I think the "error" he is talking
about is

(greater-p 60000. 70000) -> T

due to base being 8 instead of 10, and the . forcing read of 60000. in
base 10.

Lispm Users,
        While running 5.2 on a 3600 made at TI CSL from 5.0/5.1 via
loading Patches I find that under certain conditions our Namespace
machine requires manual login (ie. force-user-to-login).  I have heard
some rumors about a "5.2 Prime" but I haven't heard what fixes are
incorporated in that Release. Did anyone have a fix for this bug
before Release 6 was installed? (other than dedicating a Lispm as
Namespace Server)
                                Thanks in Advance,

	Well, I did some poking around, and I found that variable
	TELNET:*TERMINAL-SIMULATOR-TYPES* contains the list 
	TELNET:(VT100-TERMINAL-SIMULATOR AMBASSADOR-TERMINAL-SIMULATOR
		IMLAC-TERMINAL-SIMULATOR NULL-TERMINAL-SIMULATOR)

	But how do I switch one or the other on?

    In TELNET, you do <Network>-X and then pick it out of the menu.  In
    SUPDUP, it is irrelevant, since you are using the SUPDUP virtual
    terminal protocol.

It's not irrelevent.  To run, e.g. EMACS at STANFORD I must connect to
an intermediate machine (which will use SUPDUP by default).

Experimental RELATUS 131.189, FEP 22, on Lisp Machine Jim Morrison:

Now that there are so many Lisp Machines on the chaos net at MIT as well as
the symbolics net, we need a better finger system to avoid cluttered screen
and to get the information desired.  It should have the following features:

* It should be constraint oriented.  You specify some constraints on what you
want to see and you get it.  Typical constraints are a user logged in, a home
machine, idle times, namespaces, location (e.g., 7th floor), organization
(e.g., MIT).

* Constraints should be recordable so that particular patterns can be bound to
numveric args to function F.

* Constraints should be extensible by users.

* Better layout for large amounts of information.

* No namespace lossage slowing up the works.

* Periodic retrying of patterns until success in the background, with 
notification oriented reporting of success.

* Mouse sensitive users and hosts displayed.  For users, whois, read their
mail, dired their homedir, or converse with then is a good start.  For hosts,
examination of the file system, printing the disk label, transfering bands,
spying on the screen array, remote login, telnet, batch jobs, eval serving,
booting from bands, and file serving from zmacs as well as zmail is a good
start.  Menus should be dynamically computed, showing only executable options.
Operations should be user extensible.

* Finger system should be able to use gateways and networks to do many of the
above, when protocols support the functionality.  The pathway should be either
specifiable by the user or automatically computed by the namespace loser.

* A prize collection of DCP's random hacks should be available by setting a
*random* variable.

* Fingering should be fast when done in the foreground.

Experimental RELATUS 131.189, FEP 22, on Lisp Machine Jim Morrison:

If the namespace loser was a well-defined database system, it would be
possible to reference namespace objects using constraints that specified
features of the objects desired.  

* Only objects satisfying the constraint description should be returned.

* The descriptive constraints should be user extensible.

* Evaluation time should not be a function of the size of the database for
constraints utilizing information cached by the namespace system.  (A little
hierarchy can help here.)

* This could be very useful for the new finger system.

The namespace would then be able to answer questions such as what machines at
MIT are running rel 6 and what machines in the pacific time zone, on the arpa
net, are tops-20 sites.

    Look at the end of the message.  I think the "error" he is talking
    about is

    (greater-p 60000. 70000) -> T

    due to base being 8 instead of 10, and the . forcing read of 60000. in
    base 10.

Relax everybody.  In Release 6 we have changed the base to #10r10 so
people can once again use their thumbs to count with.

	    Well, I did some poking around, and I found that variable
	    TELNET:*TERMINAL-SIMULATOR-TYPES* contains the list 
	    TELNET:(VT100-TERMINAL-SIMULATOR AMBASSADOR-TERMINAL-SIMULATOR
		    IMLAC-TERMINAL-SIMULATOR NULL-TERMINAL-SIMULATOR)

	    But how do I switch one or the other on?

	In TELNET, you do <Network>-X and then pick it out of the menu.  In
	SUPDUP, it is irrelevant, since you are using the SUPDUP virtual
	terminal protocol.

    It's not irrelevent.  To run, e.g. EMACS at STANFORD I must connect to
    an intermediate machine (which will use SUPDUP by default).

Technically, it is irrelevent.  It is not the duty of the LispM to
emulate an AAA (or whatever) over a SUPDUP connection, it is the
responsibility of the TELNET program on your gateway machine to do the
emulation (from AAA (or whatever) to local VTS which eventually winds up
as SUPDUP).

    No, there are various things you can do.  The most extreme is cold

    	(send (dbg:arg 0) :reset)
    to reset the host unit.  Or
    	(fs:file-login nil)
    to logout all current file connections so it will login next time.  Or
    	(neti:reset) (neti:enable)

In release 6.0, CL:DEFSTRUCT, along with other Common Lisp changes,

Not in today's user interface.  That would break if we put in a top
level command that used C as it's "go to this mode" character.
Furthermore, C for "Chaos Connections" isn't very generic.
