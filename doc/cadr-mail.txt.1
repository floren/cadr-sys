By the way, the fact that it was "FILE serving BASSET" is just because I
was looking at your directory structure to try to find your problem with
inability to create directories.  This has no direct relationship to the
crash, which was a hardware problem, so don't be alarmed if you see that

Attempts, possibly ill-fated, are being made to restore the Lab's Lisp
Machines to their former pristine state, after the late summer madness.  You
can help by sending mail to BUG-HARDWARE telling if you have broken
keyboards, mice, memory boards, or other Lisp Machine components sitting
around in your office, machine room, automobile, or what have you.  Better
yet, you could bring them to 936.

If your machine or machines have less than 256K of memory, send mail to
BUG-HARDWARE.  It is no longer necessary or even desirable to cannibalize or
gut other machines to make yours work; and it is no longer a good idea to
steal, hoard, or lock up Lisp Machine components.  So if you got 'em, give
'em back, or we'll snip some wires on your backplanes, O.K.?

AI's tape drive is broken. no, not either of OZ's; AI's.  we suspect
that the heads are misaligned; marty worked on this this weekend with
some help from a DEC repairman who was here for some other reason
(work on OZ or something).  that seems to have made it better, but it
still doesn't work.  symptoms:
	before marty worked on it, any attempt to read
files from tape generated continuous
BAD HEADER    +34  iyd`768
BAD HEADER    +34  iyd`768
...
where the garbage given as the bad header was the same during
each attempt to read from a tape, but different with different
attempts (i.e. if i rewound the tape and tried again it said
BAD HEADER s*  df87r eu
BAD HEADER s*  df87r eu
...) the garbage usually contained some spaces and often included
a legible dir name.
	after marty worked on it, it gave BAD HEADER errors
again, but this time the headers were sometimes different, e.g.
two of one kind followed by two of another. 

marty says one bit was rather far off when they were trying to
readjust the skew (realign the heads); maybe it did not get
corrected enough. please call dec in and get them to fix it.

Pull out the memory board (with the power off!) and return it to Symbolics
as broken.  Take your highest-numbered memory board (normally farthest
right) and change its switches to be the same as the one you remove, so you
only lose one memory board instead of all boards with address >= the one
removed.

Or send your mail to the people who maintain your machine, instead
of BUG-HARDWARE @ MC.

This sounds like a hardware bug, not a ZMAIL bug.
Normally the run bar does not completely stay on, with
no paging or flickering, unless something is wrong, such
as looping in the scheduler or microcode, or a hardware failure.

Someone left CADR-9 in an unbootable state yesterday.  It was a simple
"current band unbootable" problem, which I have fixed, but the condition
I found it in was the result from at least three independent human
policy errors:

1) An band (89.11) was moved to the machine but never tested.  A single
test would have shown that, even though 89.11 works in general, this band
was unbootable.  MORAL: If you don't have time to test it, you don't have
time to move it.

2) No message was sent to BUG-HARDWARE@OZ when the machine crashed.  No
note was left on the machine.  MORAL: If you break something or find it
broken, report it.  People will get even madder if you don't.

3) A LOD on the CADR-9 disk pack, which I labelled "bad band!" long ago,
was recently relabeled "Empty".  Naturally, eventually someone moved a
band to it, and it wouldn't boot.  MORAL: In this life, all disks have
bad sectors.  Some are finessed in formatting; others are discovered the
hard way and labeled for the next generation.  Watch carefully for those
headstones!

I think most of us know all this, but I've CC'ed this to 7AI because with
the current hardware staff shortage, we can't afford to start getting sloppy.

To: bug-hardware at MIT-OZ

I recently noticed that both CADR-9 and CADR-27 have loosely mounted
connectors for their debug cables, probably a common problem due to the
way the connectors are held on.  This makes it hard to connect the cable
properly, and may be responsible for the high debug-cable death-rate.  A
lab-wide screw tightening session for these might decrease that fatality
rate.

DPH was wrong about that partition.  From way back, it wouldn't boot
copies of working systems, even with compatible microcode.  I
discovered that a year ago or so; when I reported it I there was a
shortage of disk packs, so I labeled the partition.  (Perhaps it's
me who's at fault, for not reporting it widely enough.)

When I started debugging the machine this time, I tried repeatedly to
boot to that band (89.11) with the correct microcode (183) and it
failed every time.  In the process of relabeling it BAD BAND!!, I
DISK-SAVEd a different system, and it didn't hang during booting.  But
that shouldn't be surprising!  Different systems use parts of the
disks differently; the flaky sector would just screw someone later.

There are more disks now, so this one should be reformatted or replaced.
But in general, t300s are big enough that if there is any question of
a hard or soft error, label it and avoid it.

According to its herald, CADR 16 has a total of 128K physical memory.
This means that 256K has been stolen.  Do you keep a log of which
boards belong to which machines?  If so, could you tell us which
machines have more memory than they should?  Thank you.

I hope you mean, "This means that 128K has been stolen," because I don't
believe that LCS paid for extra memory boards for that machine, and all Lisp
machines being made at that time were being sent out with 256K total, as far
as I know.  Correct me if I'm wrong.

Anyway, no, we don't keep a log of which boards belong to which machines, but
I'm pretty darned sure I know which research group's machines your memory
ended up on.  Go to Alex Krymm, room 936, and he will give you two memory
boards as soon as he has them debugged.

i don't know what dec did, but either the drive isn't aligned or none of
the tapes are. i tried the experiment of reading files off various ai gfr
tapes. GFR21 produced parity errors and non-recoverable data errors;
there was a label on it claiming that it was bad, so i decided the
labeler might have been right and tried other tapes. both GFR23 and
GFR16 (which was made a year ago) produce BAD HEADER errors. 
i remain to be convinced that DEC provided anything other than provocative
maintenance on the tape drive. i still can't do backups with it.

    This means that 256K has been stolen.
Bear in mind that if some of your memory is broken (so broken that the trivial
memory size test during booting can detect that it is broken), the machine
doesn't use it, nor any extant memory at higher addresses.  So if you want
to know how much memory is really in the machine, you have to go look.  If
there is more than it thinks it has than the board at the next higher address
(in your case, board #2 since they are 64K each and start at 0) is probably
broken.  If the amount it thinks it has is not a multiple of 64K then the
board containing the boundary is certainly broken.

The disk currently connected to CADR2 is in fact the disk that

until then CADR8 is still out of service.

CADR8's keyboard doesn't work, either.  The physical keyboard is
ok, but the connection between the keyboard and the machine
isn't there.

More problems with CADR2/CADR8:

The CADR8 disk drive, which was just put in service to replace CADR2's
ailing drive, now no longer works.  When I found that CADR2 wasn't
working, I went upstairs and found that the drive had spun itself down.
So I spun it up again, and tried to boot the machine.  No luck, it
stopped at microcode 528 (the same place that it normally stops while
waiting for the drive to spin up).  I threw the switch to spin down the
drive, but it refused to spin down!  So I cut the main power.

I looked at it pretty closely and discovered that the +-50V circuit
breaker inside was blown.  I decided to put my own disk pack into the
drive and try a few things.  When I attempted to turn the breaker back
on with the main power breaker on, it wouldn't go; however by turning
off the main power, turning on the other breaker, and turning back on
the main power, it stayed on.  However, the drive still refused to spin
up.

I then disconnected drive #2 from CADR27 and attempted to connect it to
CADR2.  This new drive spun up just fine, but CADR2 kept on stopping at
microcode 528.  Reasoning that perhaps it was the disk controller, I
swapped in the controller from CADR8, but the behavior remained the
same.

At this point I had changed the cabling, disk controller, and drive on
CADR2, and its behavior remained exactly the same.

DPH and I then attempted to connect up CADR27's disk to CADR8 and see if
it would boot.  In the process of putting back the disk controller
board, we noticed that CADR2's DC had some loose pins.  But CADR8's
board was OK.  We put it back in, then tried to bring up the machine.
The drive spun up ok, but the machine stopped at microcode 598, without
ever trying to seek.  Not having any other possibilities in mind, we
gave up.

i don't think it's misaligned heads, people. i took a blank new tape,
put it on ml, and copied the file ML:CENT;SAS TALE (4+ blocks of
amusing text) to the MT0: device. then i took the tape over to AI and
tried copying from the MT0: device to DSK:. i got two different chunks
of controlified gibberish, which are in the files AI:CENT; TRY 1 and
TRY 2; they are each exactly 6 blocks long. the file from ML is really
on the tape; i tried copying it back from MT0: to DSK:CENT;FOO FOO, and
srccom'ing found no differences. the tape is labelled TEMP 2, and is
on my desk in 926, if anyone is interested in IT.
but i think the problem is either in ai's tape drive or tape drive
controller. ty, what's the story on DEC doing maintenance on wed.?
are they really going to do something useful? for this tape problem
maybe?

It looks to me like there isn't any one on the other end of BUG-HARDWARE
listening to people talking about things like fixing tape drives.  That is,
if you say that a Lisp Machine is broken, Krymm will go frotz with it and
make it work, but if you say that the tape drive is broken, there isn't
anyone who gets BUG-HARDWARE who will make sure that it works.  I was under
the impression that Ty was the person who traditionally interfaced with the
field circus people, but clearly this isn't happening this time.

Penny, if you feel up to it (that is, if you're in the right phase), you
should probably call up field circus yourself and tell them to fix the thing
and make sure that it works before they go away.  And if it doesn't work,
they should do whatever is necessary to make it work, short of replacing it
altogether, which would probably be an unjustifiable expense.  However, you
should feel free to get them to replace motors and random tronics in its
guts, regardless of how much Lester the Molester or whoever yabbles about it.

Cadr25 has an intermittent fault that causes bad parity words
to be written onto disk, causing later unexpected crashes. Also
its disk drive is broken. Connecting it to another disk drive in
its present state will probably cause it to munge the label (at least)
of the disk pack. Also (possibly unrelated)the PC does not always 
start at address 00000 when powered on.

    so it's not typing anything.

i replaced the fuse and turned on the console; it began typing funny, as if
it was losing some of the output, and then blew the fuse again. CBF came
over and fixed the problem, which was an incorrectly-implaced, and thus
too tight, ribbon; would whoever put it in please have someone competent
check him out in this before he tries replacing the ribbon again.

They (and a couple of their friends, T31 and T34, but those two don't
seem prone to run amok) appear to have come detached somewhere between
the I/O-11 and the patch panel on the 8th floor.  TY and Joe Ricchio
have promised to go up in the ceiling above the patch panel and check
the situation out.  Meanwhile back at the ranch, we try to set their
LSPEED's to 0 when the system is brought up, this seems to keep them
"off line" (so to speak).

it's still chronically losing. the problem seems to definitely be in either
the power cord or the cord connecting the keyboard to the monitor. the point
of contact under the keyboard of the cable that runs to the back of the
monitor is the prime suspect. it should be easy to reproduce this lossage.
the effects on the screen of just playing with the cable are reasonably 
graphic so they're easy to spot when they happen.

IOB#32 is plugged into CADR-6 right now.  IOB#12 is on CADR-25.  IOB#12 works
on CADR-6, I think (at least there were no complaints when it was plugged in
on CADR-6).  IOB#32 does work on CADR-25, but has no serial I/O, so it is
impossible to run the Puma with it.  More precisely, IOB#32 has serial O but
no serial I.  IOB#12 has serial I/O.  Thus the switch.

But: IOB#12 does not quite work on CADR-25.  It seems to send and receive
OPN, ANS, CLS, and STS just fine, but it doesn't really seem to be too hot on
those old data packets.  The symptom is, it boots up, gets the time, answers
to NAME, even tells you who's on Lisp Machines, answers its own HOSTAT and
just does fine on those low opcodes, but as soon as you try to do something
that requires data packets, it says, "BARFOLA!  Chaos connection
#<YOUR-MOTHER-WEARS-ARMY-BOOTS> went into illegal state while waiting for
transaction."  The connection has received a LOS.  It looks like the far end
waits around and then times out and sends a LOS along?  Or sumpin.  Could we
be missing a bit (like, say, the 200's bit)?  Anyone have a more reasonable
thory?

ai apparently has a dead board. gsb watched it try to boot, and believes
it is dying on the half-word boundary trying to print out DSKDMP (it
says "DSK", then decrements wrong and prints "3.N,Z"; then somehow gets
back to the beginning of the loop and starts with "DSK" again, so that
it prints a solid line of "DSK3.N,Z" across the page). gsb diagnoses
this as the ILDB instruction being broken -- he says that's what breaks
on ML too. 
someone who can read prints and explore with a scope is needed to find
which board has broken in the processor; we think we have spares to
replace it with.

Subject: new styles for winter

It seems that at some time in the far-distant past, it became fashionable to
remove the rear shrouds from T-80's, presumably to improve cooling or
something.  At least, I guess the intention was to improve cooling, because
the only visible effect seems to be that the card cages get full of dandruff,
chewing gum, and layers of dust so thick that one can't see whether fuses are
blown or not.

Has it actually been verified that removing the shrouds is a good idea?  The
last Trident repairman I talked to pointed out that there are several LCS
T-80's which, less chic than their AI sisters, didn't go in for the bare
look, yet didn't seem to need repair any more often.  He also suggested that
"The only difference I can see, is, dese ones dat don't have the covers, dey
get more shit in the cahd cages, is all."

In any case, I looked around for the shrouds and couldn't find any.  Does
anyone know where they might have walked off to?  Looks like we have about 4
or 5 T-80's without shrouds.

Cadr-22 is having some odd problem with the keyboard. It seems that you can't
type on its keyboard faster than about 1 char per 3-5 seconds. If you type 
very fast, only very few characters actually get through. If you type a char
and then wait for it to echo and then count to 3 slowly you can then type
another character. Echo lags about a second or more, too. All in all, it's not
very good. Booting to another band (even with different microcode) has no 
effect, so the problem is almost surely in hardware and probably in the 
keyboard. Also, even c-m-c-m-rubout does not tend to work very reliably. You
have to hold down the keys for a long time or try a lot or something before
it finally takes. Output (eg, from (PRINT-DISK-LABEL)) if you have the patience
to type slowly enough to complete an s-expression seems to come at the normal
speed so the processor and memory seem to be working fine...

CADR-30 does not generate sound.  This is not a problem in the wiring or the

Cadr-22 is powered off the unswitched part (unswitched????) of the box
that sits under the regulated power supply.  There are two circuit breakers
on opposite sides.  The circuit breaker that is not on the processor side is the
good one, and it keeps tripping because all the power is being run through it. 
I reconnected some of the cooling fans to some power outlet in the floor, in
order to reduce the load a little.

CADR-19 is still living in the fast lane.  The idle time in the wholine
changes by 40 hours per 3 seconds.  The blinkers are doing their pathetic
best to keep up.  Needless to say, it can't establish any Chaos connections
in this state -- they time out in a few nanoseconds.

It calmed down for a little while yesterday when Krymm came into the room,
said a few words, and passed his hands over the console.  I took advantage of
the intermission to bring over a working system from CADR-30, but as soon as
Krymm left the room it started speeding again.

Anyway, the clock in the who-line seems to be keeping more or less normal
time, but (process-sleep 6000.) seems not to sleep at all.  I'm a little
worried about the long-term effects of this lack of sleep on the processor.
I've seen what happens to speed freaks after they've gone for a week without
sleep.  CADR-19 could be reduced to a burned-out shadow of its former self,
wandering around the network asking other processors for the time, but never
able to keep its attention on them long enough to find out the answer.

P.S.  Whoever fixes this, please contact me.  I have a friend I'd like you to
take a look at.

The board you swapped was a good board. There appears to be slight 
variation in the amount of power drawn by different boards if I understand
correctly. Board 50 is one of the "heavy" drain boards, which is why it
couldn't be run on Cadr-22. It ought to run fine on Cadr-9 when it comes back
up at least until Cadr-9 is upgraded to 512K in which case there's a chance
it'll have the same trouble Cadr-22 was having in driving all its memory 
boards. At that time, someone may want to trade it back to us. For now, I
think the change is no worse for anyone else and better for us. Thanks.

    It was independently verified that CADR-9's disk did not survive
    Sunday's power outage.  We probably should have put a sign on it.

Subject:AI-CHAOS-11

I am documenting this here so that no one loses the way I just did.

Jon and I wheeled the 11/40 over to next to the ai-chaos-11.  I had
previously severed the Unibus on the 11/40 after the processor and memory.
The 11/40 has 24K of memory; the boot roms are high enough so that it
shouldn't have conflicted.  Anyway, we verified that the processor was
working after we got it to its new location (despite the fact that the Unibus
wasn't yet terminated).  We disconnected the Unibus cable coming out of the
11/10, or 11/05, or whatever a GT40 is, and put a unibus cable coming out of
the 11/40 in where it had been.

Over my fervent protests, Jon then powered it up and destroyed everything.
Then we powered up the 11/40, and noticed that bits 16 and 17 in the address
register were stuck on, and were unaffected by reset.  Load address didn't
work.  The bus light was on.  In general, the thing was broken.  We removed
the unibus cable and terminated the bus, and the thing was stil unhappy.  It
is broken, so something on the backplane under the GT40 eats PDP-11's.

I suspect the 11 side of the 10-11 interface of losing somehow, although I
have no good reason for my suspicions.  I didn't look long enough at the code
to know whether removing the 10-11 interface board will cause it to generate
NXM's.  Any advice would be appreciated; DEC should have things fixed
tomorrow afternoon.

The GT40's unibus cable is hanging in thin air right now, so anyone tempted
to play with it tonight should take note of this.

Subject: This is aMAZing!!!!!

Let me describe the cricumstances, then I'll describe my theory.

From main campus, subnet 7:

A connection could not be made to any host at Tech Square.
However, we could get from subnet 7 to EE which must use subnet
1.  Viewing the routing tables of the various bridges showed that
there was no route to any hosts at Tech Square.

Chaosnetting to Multics and ARPA TCPing to MC revealed the
following from MC (near the other end of subnet 1):

All the bridges on subnet 1 responded.  ALL of them, including
the ones on the main campus.  Additionally, all sizes of packets
could be sent and received from all bridges.  The routing tables,
however, showed no route.  (I think the reason they responded at
all was because they were using old hop information even though
the cost was maximum.)  No hosts on subnet 7 could be accessed,
nor could speech or EE.  I assume this is because the various
routing tables did not get cast in cement, so old hop information
only worked for exactly one intervening bridge (in this case the
intervening bridge was MC-IO-11).

Each end of subnet 1 had routing information for itself, but not
for the other end.

Theory: routing on subnet 1 was broken, but all other packets
were making it through.  This does no good for hosts not on
subnet 1 since they have moldy (worse than stale) routing tables.

We came over to Tech Square to start disconnecting transceivers,
since in the past the Symbolics microwave transceiver has been
known to be a little flakey.  Unplugging it did not solve the
problem.  Additionally unplugging oz-network-11 and ai-chaos-11
caused routing to start to happen, and the rest of the network
started to appear.  Plugging oz-network-11 back did not cause
lossage.  Plugging scrc-microwave back did not cause lossage (it
made the symbolics subnets reappear).  Plugging ai-chaos-11 back
caused the routing tables to start to monotonically increase.

Hmmm....  What's going on here?  

AI-chaos-11 was hung.  No big deal, it does that.  It's chaos
board should be doing nothing.  Unwedging ai-chaos-11 and
starting it at 1000 (the program's starting address) caused
routing packets to be received again.  Hmmm.....

Theory: AI-chaos-11's chaosnet interface was (incorrectly)
deciding that it should send aborts for hardware broadcast
packets.  This would explain some things:

Main campus could use subnet 1 because ai-chaos-11's aborts did
not have enough energy to abort routing packets on the main
campus end.  (Also, some of the transceivers at main campus are
inches apart.)  Tech Square could talk to itself by reverting to
subnet 6.

Conclusions: A unibus chaos baord should be generated ASAP for
ai-chaos-11.  Until then, ai-chaos-11 should NEVER be left
halted/hung with the power on.  OR, the baord should be fixed.
This may be slightly tricky.  My guess is it has a rev2 chaos
baord (none built for at least 3 years).  There may some prints
around the lab, or there may be some prints at EE.

This is an amazing incident, and I'm moderately freaked out.

I replaced the subnet 1 board in the AI-CHAOS-11.  It was actually Pyggy's
board, one of the recent ones (#103) that Krymm and I had put in it while
testing this morning, and were too burned and lazy to replace once the thing
was working.  I returned its original subnet 1 board to it; that board is
marked Quad Chaos #2, so it's earlier than you thought.  The other board in
there was Quad Chaos #13; it at least had CSR switches.  To fix #13 (which is
also earlier than Rev. 2) we had to borrow a set of prints from EE.

Everything seems okay right now; a (hostat) shows main campus subnet 1 hosts
responding just fine, but it's only been half an hour since I booted it.

affecting the tape drive. ^Z, which should halt any job in its tracks, does
pop me up to HACTRN level, but the tape drive keeps going. all that seems
to get the drive's attention once it gets into this state is turning it
offline; this stops it, and then i can do all the normal offline things.

i have cleaned the drive, and i have powercycled it (i think). these do

I think (as you seem to) that we'd find it easiest to debug this by exchanging
the subnet 6 interface and seeing if that makes things win, because the cable
and the transceiver are not obviously losers, but the only interface I can come
up with just now is Pyggy's board, which was for a while the AI-CHAOS-11 subnet
6 board, and seemed to wedge subnet 1.

So we're going to have to wait a bit to put the OZ-NET-11 back on the net,
until we can come up with another interface.

Moon suggested that the drive is getting continuous write errors, and the
4 blocks is the available buffer length.

in concord with this theory, JPG observed that MC's tape drive had similar
symptoms last month.  DEC eventually decided there was a parity error
in the drive's internal core (or is this part of the controller?), so they
replaced the core, or part of it.

must be cold booted.  (This only happens after you try to change
something.)

Alas, it appears that cadr-2 is busted again. It does not boot. When
I push the boot button on the machine, the disk drive seeks (I can 
tell this by feeling the drive) but the microcode counter stops at
00032, which I believe is the "can't load" location. Sigh.

Cadr-6's video monitor is displaying nothing but horizontal lines,
rendering the machine unusable.  I unplugged it.
The machine still talks to the chaosnet ok, but it won't listen to its keyboard.
There is a note from someone else, saying the same thing happened on Monday.

Hi Guys!
	Hope you had a good vacation!  I managed to get cadr15 running.
The monitor seems a bit scrod though.   It is not scanning right.  First
it was scanning too much so a shadow appeared, not it is not scanning
much at all.  Have a good day.

In Release 4.0, site configuration 6, on Lisp Machine Two:

I can't tell if this is a hardbug or software bug.  

Rel 4.0 will not run on this Lisp Machine.  After the most nominal
amount of consing it thinks it has used up all its virtual memory.  I
can reproduce this bug just by logging in and doing (load
"src:<circuit>defsystem").  (It chokes while trying to create an
array for the symbol table of a newly declared
package.)  I have tried rel 4.0's and mcr's from various cadr's doing
compare-bands all the way with no success.  I have varied the bands I
put the rel 4.0 and mcr on.  Nothing helps.  System 91 (as least 91's
loaded before this machine recent spat of problems) will boot and run
OK.  Doing (gc-status) to the out-of-memory-trap says there is lots of
room left.

Allow me to take this opportunity to flame at the jerk who
originally moved rel 4.0 to this machine without testing it
(and destroyed the only vanilla 91 on this machine in the process):
Go away, we don't need you.

CADR-7 began generating losing video, the monitor began to screech (no sync

	...

    marty, could you look into this?

AI tape drive is back.

-  The EOT (end of tape) senser was loose, and can swing into a bad
   angle so that tapes cannot be loaded. I tightened it after finding 
   a suitable position.

-  Cleaned the head.

-  Removed a silly red wire that wasn't connected to anything but
   which may have been touching random pins when the door was closed.

After this I was able to dump and read back a directory, and to list a
random incremental tape (incr. 238).

So, give it a try, we'll see how long it lasts this time.

Subject: CADR-9 has only 192K

This bug report is a little late: CSTACY and I took a closer look at
CADR-9 the other night, and discovered that althought 4 memory boards
were visible, one of them (MW#34 as I recall) was not actually plugged
into the cadr cage.  Combined with the delay in upgrading it to 384K,
this left it with an "unusable" 192K.  Booting with this board in (at
address 0) produced peculiar behavior: the machine appeared to halt at
alternating locations in low mem (all around location 40), "halting"
repeatedly at intervals of around 1Hz, without a discernible pattern.
(We were unable to reproduce this exact behavior, or to boot with that
board without halting,, but it might be a clue.)  We returned the bad
board to 936 with a note attached.

We began a project to snarf good memory boards out of broken CADR-18,
but apparently this has already been done!  Someone with more
knowledge of memory board resources should find 1 or 2 good memory
boards to put in CADR-9, and maximize our "usable" machines.

memory boards around was a pure waste of time.  The problem was a bad contact

Enabling unibus interrupts for serial i/o on CADR-25 causes the machine to

CADR-3 wasn't being used this afternoon so I recovered our missing memory
board (board #68) from it. CADR-22 is now running its full 512K.

By the way, when I went up to take down CADR-3, I noticed that it was in
a wedged state in software. Typing any character (including Terminal and
System) just beeped. This is probably a bug in the software for the default
band. I mention it only because I didn't want anyone who walks in later
expecting things to work to assume my swapping the boards is what broke it.
That condition was in effect prior to when I took the board out.

You are describing a wedged keyboard.  It was probably sending characters to
the machine that don't make any sense to a Lisp listener.  You can boot a
keyboard by pressing the boot button underneath it.  I would bet that you could

I think this was caused by the garbage collector being left on by whoever used the machine
before Eric. Apparently the garbage collector doesnt work in system 93, or should I say
microcode 226. The band that didnt work on cadr31 was 93.11,gc@2 mcr226. I tried running
the 93.10,GC@3 band from cadr18 on cadr30 but that also illops shortly after the
garbage collector is turned on. The illops were to locations 5310 and 5315 in the scavenger.

I think you bashed the state of AP1 before sending the bug report,
perhaps by typing control-S twice.  CC is really a p.o.s.
read-compare-difference is a bit that lights up randomly and is
not an error unless you are doing read-compares, which are not
turned on by default (%disk-switches can turn them on; it's in
the system 78 release notes or some obscure place like that).
So the original disk error status got cleared somehow before
you did that cc-disk-analyze.

The color monitor intermittintly stops working.
Symptoms: The monitor blinks out after some random period of
time.  
          Power cycling it brings it back for only a second or two
and then blinks out again.
          The Horizontal sweep is on for that on period as evidenced
by the hiss, and then it shuts down.
          After repeating this a few times it doesn't come back at all.
          There seems to be nbo excess of heat on the board or
anything wrong with the fuse or wire connections.

          This same problem occured on Cadr-8's color monitor last week
but was pulled back to life by a long power off cycle.

Any clues?
Is there anyone that takes care of these things?
Who has hacked them before, so I might get some advice?

I guess I object to random transciever disconnection if it is intended

soemthing.  It just seems to make more problems than it fixes.

Subject: chaosnet status

Transmission from the MC-IO-11 to the AI-CHAOS-11 is losing.  Symptoms are:
very low pkt transmission rate, AI-CHAOS-11 seems dead to MC for several
minutes at a time.  Occasionally it wins.  Moving down the cable to OZ,
things are a little better.  The AI-CHAOS-11 answers STATUS most of the time
from OZ.  Occasionally it doesn't respond for periods of a minute or so.
When it start responding, the lost packet count is a couple hundred higher.

What's stranger is that none of the error counts on the MC-IO-11 or the
AI-CHAOS-11 are rising very fast at all.  Lost and abort counts on both
subnet 6 and 1 on both MC-IO-11 and AI-CHAOS-11 are respectably low compared
to pkts-in and pkts-out.  CRC and other errors are very low.

I tried very hard last night (this morning) to convince myself that the
AI-CHAOS-11 was at fault, but I was unsuccessful.  I replaced transceivers
and interfaces with ones known to be winning, both subnets 6 and 1, and the
problem continued.  The processor is acting like a working processor.

I have not touched the MC-IO-11 at all, but it acts reasonable, I guess.

Perhaps the cable between the two is at fault.

More bits: TFTP from XX to the dover is very unreliable these days, much more
so than ever before.  Times out all the time.  Could the Ethernet be broken
somehow and somehow eating a lot of the CHAOS-11's time (constant
retransmission using bus for DMA or sumpin)?  I realize this is a little
spacey, but I'm at wits' end.  I may try disconnecting the ether flat cable
and running the AI-CHAOS-11, seeing if it's more reliable at talking to MC
then.  Otherwise I am going to go over the cable some.

I badly need advice.

Gee, this is a long shot.  Remember several months ago when the transceiver
on the AI-CHAOS-11 was intermittent?  It got moved to LM-20 somehow,
where it was less dangerously intermittent.  When I was able to get
a replacement transceiver from Fred, I got hold of the intermittent
transceiver and gave it to Fred with a little note about it
being intermittent.  Well, I talked to him the other day and
he said he couldn't find anything wrong with it and returned it
to service.  Anybody know where a recently fixed transceiver
may have gone?  Could it be the problem?

You know that message I sent tonight about the AI-CHAOS-11 and the MC-IO-11
not being able to talk to each other well for reasons undetermined?
Something in it wasn't quite true.  While I did swap the sn 6 interface, I
didn't swap the sn 6 transceiver, because I couldn't see how the sn 6
transceiver could be messing things up in such a way that the sn 1 interface
didn't read stuff from MC, but did read stuff from anything else on sn 1.

Well, now I'm a true believer.

Connections between MC and the AI-CHAOS-11 are still losing.  COnnections
between OZ and the AI-CHAOS-11 win more often.  For the past few hours I've
tried to convince myself the it's the AI-CHAOS-11 without success.  I swapped
transceivers, subnet 1 interfaces, etc.  I'll try the sn 6 interface now, but
it's clear that this is a pretty silly idea (packets get lost on sn 1).  I
think there's something broken between the AI-CHAOS-11 and MC-IO-11, like a
cable.

From the evidence of an earlier message, i would say your
machine is getting parity errors, not disk errors.  The disk
will signal an error if it gets a parity error
during a disk transfer.  Read-compare-difference is
not an error unless the disk operation was a read-compare
(unlikely, since it isn't used by default).

I assume you typed in the line that says
"cc-disk-analyze gives read-compare-difference"?

I pesume you typed :WHY before :MAIL, which may
have caused the error to go away by the time you
did the :MAIL.  Generally, you should do :MAIL
*INSTEAD* of :WHY.  I guess I should fix
this already.

the keyboard boots, it gives tones that indicate it thinks it is connected

no run bar on the screen, however, and keyboard input and mouse control are
absent. That's about all I can say for it. I hope someone has the time to

I moved CADR-4, which has been without a home on the 9th floor
for a while, to the 7th floor machine room, because we urgently
needed to test music hardware on the 7th. CADR-4 came up fine, but
after powering it down to straighten up the cables and tweak the
final position of the machine, it began exhibiting this symptom:

Spins up fine.
On booting CADR, does "emergency head retract" at first disk seek,
but continues to spin, while CADR halts at location 40.

I swapped the disk pack. disk controller card, and the disk/CADR
cables, and always got the same symptom.  The pack boots on other
drives.  So it appears to be the drive.

    Did you level the disk drive?  This might be its problem.

I leveled it several times.  When I first moved it, I leveled it
easily (I thought), and it worked fine.  I leveled it again after
adjusting its position slightly, before the problem occured.  Later,
GUMBY suggested a reliable way to use the level - setting it on the
ring where the disk pack is mounted - and I re-leveled it very
carefully.  Always the same behavior, on known-good disk packs.

    I hpe you inspected the heads on CADR-4's disk before moving
    the pack to another machine, or there may now be two crashed
    drives and two crashed packs.

I moved the CADR-4 pack to CADR-20, where it booted, and then tried it
again in CADR-4 where it failed again.  CADR-20 is running fine.  But
thanks for the warning, I should be more cautious, diagnosing disks is
not my specialty.  ***

If you're wondering why a graduate student is out on his own
installing machines and diagnosing disks, it's because I learned that
for the past few weeks NOT ONLY has there been power on the 7th for
one more T300 and an unknown number of CADRs with T-80's, but CADR-4
has been unused and without a console.  Nothing had been done, and I
was all furiouser because I hadn't been made aware of the situation.

Apparently it's not widely known how badly some lab members are still
being hurt by the 7 month delay with the machine room.  People in the
music group, including undergraduate thesis students and UROPs, are
unable to hear a single program because of that delay, and delays in
other solutions sought from staff (e.g. long-distance cable drivers
from Fred Drenckahn).  It's a disaster, with just some hope of healing
by the end of the semester.

Yesterday I learned about concerns that the Music Group would try to
"commandeer" the 7th floor machines.  Since the Music Group will be
using special hardware, but has not bought "its own" machines, I agree
that it's important to generally announce this, and that people can't
be "bumped" by group members the way they can on some machines.  I'll
do that.  But I pray that the installation of the machines will be
hastened, rather than held up, by our urgent need.

It's spelled with one 'l'.  Just to be sure, I checked.  I found the
closest part of the definition to Zvona's use, in American Heritage, interesting:

    3. A groove or flange designed to hold the beveled edge of a watch
    crystal or a gem.

Did you ever think of a CRT tube as being like a gem?  I suppose it's
more like a watch crystal.  There is probably an intermediate gap in
the Entymology, but it's an interesting thought.

Yesterday evening, Bill Dubuque came in asking what was the matter with
his Cadr. He said it was turned off and he had powered it up but that it
seemed to think it had only 64K of memory. I don't know much about Cadrs,
but figured we could at least check the boards to make sure someone hadn't
been stealing memory. We spun the disks down on both and then turned off
the power. I pulled the boards on one of them (the one Bill said thought
it had too little memory) and all the dip switches seemed to be set right.
We replacd the boards and powered both machines back on, then both disk
packs on. The lights flashed as if the disks were spinning up, then both
lights simultaneously died and the disks appeared to not be working. One
of the machines we had done nothing with (save turn off and on again) so
we couldn't have hurt it; the other we were very careful to replace the
boards as they had been, so I'm pretty sure we didn't have any effect on
things there either. Since we couldn't figure out what was up, we left these
machines turned off. They are LM15 and LM16; their homes are ``near the
XGP'' in the Cadr Corral.

Today, I came in and found Cadr-22's console dark. When I went upstairs,
I noticed that its power switches (disk and cpu) were on, the breakers
were on, but there was no power to the machine. I set the switch on the
disk to be off and then tried power cycling the machine with no effect.
DANIEL said that he smelled something that smelled like a ``burnt chip.''
The two problems (the smell of fried chip and the lack of power) may or
may not be related.

In any case, the bottom line is that some cadrs are broken and I thought
I'd bring it to your attention and hope you'll have time to look into 
fixing them soon. Thanks muchly.

It has been reported to me that the video connector to the console
was flakey for awhile and would work only in certain positions.
Now it doesn't work in any position.  I don't have time to fix
this now, but whoever does fix the Cadr in general should know
why they don't get any video.

is losing again (so what else is new). this looks like the error
we ran into in jan.(?) where i think the write head was the problem?
sypmtoms: i start an incr. dump and the tape goes round but never
gets beyond .; . inspection of the log file shows that it has lost
in trying to write the first real, undumped file. a look at the job
in peek shows the amount of file written is exactly 4 blocks -- while
the tape continues to progress.
i think we decided that the buffer was 4+0 long, but i forget the rest
of the solution. marty, could you have another chat with it? thx..

Those symptoms indicate continual write errors I think.  The system
just keeps retrying but no write ever succeeds.  Probably because
the tape controller reads back what it wrote and the read back gets garbage..

I think CADR 6 is having chaosnet trouble.
I tried several times to read the file
SYS:WINDOW;SHWARM LISP into ZWEI, and it would always
say "error: attempt to read from a connection that got a LOS:
connection is not in the right state."
The "fasl nibble without check bit" error that STRAZ was getting
is also believed to be a consequence of bits lost in the chaosnet
interface or transceiver of CADR 6 (since it only happens there).
Such lossages have been happening intermittently on CADR 6
for months now.

Cadr-6 has this problem with the chaos net.  It drops bits on reads.  It never seems
to drop bits on write.  It seems only to drop them while loading fasl files, but that is probably just a coincidence.

According to Dave Custer someone changed the band without changing
the appropriate microload.  This could have happened while trying to edit
the disk-label on CADR-27 if it was used as a slave.  By omitting
the "cc" you are actually modifying cadr-22's disk-label, thus
rendering cadr22 unbootable.
You can fix this by doing a (set-current-band 'lod_ "cc") or doing
a (set-current-microload 'mcr_ "cc") from another machine.

CADR-2 has died (i.e., won't boot), and in
its final hour of death claimed to be CADR-8,
in disguise.  The latter turned out to be
annoying to several people, especially after
I inadvertently power-cycled CADR-8, which
someone else was trying to use.  CADR-2's
software presently announces that CADR-2's
console is attached to CADR-8.  This creates
a problem whenever someone needs to service
a device attached to a mis-labeled machine.

can deal with myself.  Logic and power supply stuff [including the infamous
Q105 forest fire] probably have to go out.)  Turnaround time will be on the

CADR-23's monitor has a new video cable and is getting video OK now, but
there is a problem with the monitor itself. It was overscanning in both
directions, was excessively bright, and had a bad smell. I adjusted the
height and the brightness but couldnt make the smell go away so I turned
it of. Also it wouldnt boot from the keyboard (although the raised run
bar flickered a bit) but this may be something simple. Any takers ?

Subject: Cadr 1 and Cadr 5

Both of these machines died a couple of minutes ago at the same time.
Upon further examination, I found that Cadr 1 is daisy chained off 
Cadr 5.  Not a good practice.  Cadr 5 was hooked into a wiggling socket
in the wall.  This could be harmless, but the power did die.
Both disks on the machines had stopped so I powered them down, so to speak
since they were already stopped.  I have cut the main power switch on each
LM so that there won't be any unexpected surprises if power were to suddenly 
reappear.  I should also report a slight smell of a frying power supply.  This 
may have become less significant after a time.  I guess something like this
was attributed to a glitch a couple of nights ago.  Maybe that's happening now.
At any rate, the problem lies in Cadr-5's power supply, or the building power.
Somebody who knows more about these topics should maybe take a look.

I just went and sniffed around.  It seems that the burning smell is coming
(was coming) from Cadr-5' power.

CADR 15 is not responding to its keyboard.  Some things I know:

(1) It is NOT keyboard.  We switched the PROM on the kbd, tried
    the same kbd out on another CADR, and it's fine.

(2) The video is fine, so it's probably not the cable.

I think it must be a problem in the machine itself; the connections
the machine, however, seem to be okay.

CADR15's console is in 800F.  Please take a look at the machine; it
may just be a bad cable somewhere.

The error nas nothing to do with cadr18's state.  It is a bug which
AKR reported in CC in system 94.  It makes 94 basically useless for

Cadr-4 (i think), that is, the cadr whose console is just outside 702
is dead.

Cold boot loses. This came about after I set-current-band to be an MIT band.

   1) Why this lossage?
   2) I've seen this on several other machines... Why?
   3) If it's incurable (which I strongly doubt)
      why  not make set-current-band check out first
      whether it's going to get itself into a coma, and if so,
      warn the user.
   4) Set-current-band always pesters you with worrying about changing
      the microcode. Why can't it go ahead and make the change?
      At least, it ought to take Y-or-N instead of YES-or-NO.

Fixed in the source.  That band wouldn't boot for me either.  However,
when I copied different LOD and MCR bands into those partitions, the
machine booted, so it looks like the 94 or its microcode that lived
there were bad.

This seems to be a very common problem, I've noticed exactly the same
thing when setting CADR-31's band from CADR-30. Copying a disk partition
over the debug cable seemed to work OK, but when the current band was changed,
the label was messed up. It has also happened between CADR-5 and 25.

 CADR-1, running system 93.47, microcode 226, halted several times as I was trying to use
it today, Monday, 5-23-83, 13:20 pm.  Eventually, it would not recover by warm booting,
and it halted again after cold-booting.  Two of the console addresses at which it 
halted are  "23405", and, I think, "00143.".23-May-83 18:23:21-EDT,387;000000000000

CADR1 is dying with "main memory par error from disk"
during booting.  :WHY seems not to know what to do at that stage.
However, CC does mostly work if you use 94.21, which gets around the
A-V-NIL problem (A-V-NIL really is garbage at that stage), or 93.

Re: lossage on cadr-6
To: bug-hardware@MIT-OZ

I found CADR-6 saying "will not boot a 94 band".
I tried it and it got a c-mem parity error.
The 1000000000000 bit was mistakenly turned on it 636@c.

I cleared this bit and started at COLD-BOOT and it won.

I found that putting the microcode in MCR6 rather than MCR2
caused it to win.

Strangely, comparing the contents of MCR2 with the place I got
the UCADR 239 from returned T.  I cannot understand why, if
the contents compare ok, it would boot right from one and not from the other.

I left MCR2 with "bad" in its label, but the contents are still there.
Perhaps someone should try to figure out why this kind of lossage happens.

More info on the CADR 6 problem:
I tried it with a different disk pack and it lost the same way.

Also, I found that by patching the losing bit in 636@c to 0
I could get the machine to run.  But it crashed after a while
and that same bit had been clobbered to 1 again.
So the problem does not appear to be connected with booting per se.

It is fairly often hanging up so that one or more of

Resetting the keyboard with the black button underneath
cleared the immediate hangup each time but one,
but it reappeared right away elsewhere.  When I checked
the seating of the connectors in back they felt fine
but the check seems to have cleared up this sort of trouble.
Left-CTRL still sporadically drops out in the middle of a
<CTRL>-string lean.

I am having a great deal of trouble right now with various
characters not registering.  A combination of resetting and
wiggling the connector seems to have gotten me out of it
for the moment (surprisingly long - a whole sentence now)
but I can't tell when it may strike again, and sometimes
it persists through a lot of poking.  I have a notion that
it's a bad idea to use the left-CTRL key as it seems to
bring it on? but can't really tell.  It definitely isn't the

The green light on CADR-18's disk drive is lit all the time.
As a result, when I change packs on that drive I have
to guess when it is ok to open the door.

I don't know whether these disk drives ever refuse to slow
down if they are scared to retract their heads.
That was my first thought when I turned the drive off
and the light did not start flashing.
I was really scared I might hurt it by opening the door,
but that was the only way I could tell if it had stopped.

Presumably the disk people can fix this.

[This may have something to do with the disk, but I'm not so
sure.  Here are the symptoms anyway.]

After doing (SETQ LM18-PKT (CHAOS:SIMPLE "LM18")), the response is the
following:

Number: 0 (34657512)  Opcode: 5 (ANS).  Number of bytes = 36 .
From 3076-0 to 3060-10066 .
002400,000036,003060,010066,003076,000000,000000,000000
Pkt number = 0, Ack number = 0, Forwarded 0 times.
Retransmitted 0 times, last at 0.
Link = NIL
  which contains the following string:
"
107 CADR%1's Rgoe p6765
3
<MACRO>-<MACRO>" ; <MACRO> character, actually

It's probably dropping bit #? in either the lower or high byte of the
16-bit word.  Notice:

Character      Codes (octal) Index into packet-string
---------      ------------- ------------------------
9 -> 1         71 ->  61         1

o -> g         157 -> 147       15
m -> e         155 -> 145       17
p -> x         156 -> 146       19
Return -> Macro 215 -> 205      27, 29

LM18 will not respond to anything but ANS-response requests.  It can't
get the time when it boots, can't handle FILE protocol (or any kinf of
stream protocol, it seems), and can do RFCs for ANS-responses only
inconsisently. 

Perhaps the reason why some of the bands are bad on the machine is
because they were transferred when the problem was not as
consistent.

Hello,

There has been alot of confusion lately about where to mail Lisp
Machine hardware trouble reports.  In an effort to clear this up, and
make things coherent, I have rearranged the relavent mailing lists.
This message describes how things work under the new scheme.

First, some people were reporting 3600 software reports to random
places.  The place for all Lisp Machine operating software bug
reports is BUG-LISPM.  It does not matter where the machine came
from.  If it is a software problem, send it to BUG-LISPM.

There are two main mailing lists for hardware, both based on OZ.
There should be synonyms on the ITS machines too.

BUG-HARDWARE is the same as BUG-MIT-HARDWARE.
This list is mostly for broken CADRs (Lisp Machines manufactured and
maintained at MIT.)  The hardware staff at the AI lab is on this list.

BUG-SYMBOLICS-HARDWARE is for broken LM-2s and 3600s.
This is seperate from BUG-HARDWARE because the Symbolics computers
are not maintained by our own staff.  There are service contracts
for repairing these machines, and the service people should be on
this list (I think I put them on).

There also some synonyms, like this:
 BUG-CADR ==> BUG-MIT-HARDWARE
 BUG-LM2  ==> BUG-SYMBOLICS-HARDWARE
 BUG-3600 ==> BUG-SYMBOLICS-HARDWARE
 BUG-APIARY-HARDWARE ==> BUG-SYMBOLICS-HARDWARE
 BUG-PI-3600 ==> BUG-SYMBOLCS-HARDWARE

These changes should assure that hardware bug reports go to the
correct place.

If you think you want to be on or off some hardware bug list or
another, or think that another list should be created for some reason,
send me a description of what you want and I'll help you set it up
properly.

Unfortunately, for the moment users will have to remember to send bug
reports to the correct list.  When you pick "Hardware" from the BUG
menu in ZMAIL, you will get BUG-HARDWARE. People will have to manually
change the address to the right one, but that is what they have been
doing anyway.  At least now they dont have to remember n different
mailing list names.

I will try to get the Symbolics people to arrange for a software fix
for this problem: you should get the right mailing list automatically
from ZMAIL.  If nothing is forthcoming, I can kludge it up anyway.
Offhand, I think there should be a HARDWARE-BUG-REPORTS option for
each machine in the site specific information.  If anyone has ideas on
good ways to do this, please send them to me -- let's not start a big
disucssion with all of BUG-HARDWARE(s).

CADR-30 is broken; gets parity errors while writing to the page partition
during boot.  I don't think this is the disk's fault.

CADR31 seems to have a bad memory chip or something; it wedges every once in a
while, causing Eric Grimson's long-running crunchers to be lost (it can't be
warm-booted).

Taft suspects that microcode hardware. (or something like that)
In any case the machine will freeze in the middle of idling
or any generic instructions.  Warm booting brings it back.

Has anyone looked at this problem?

Should I leave it frozen?

CADR18's disk is incompatible with other disks.
A pack with data that reads ok on CADR18 does not read
on CADR5 or CADR25.
Probably the disk needs to be realigned.

I should learn to use net-hackers.  Yes, I came to the same conclusions,
and was actually wondering who did the disconection.  For those on
MIT-Network-Group you saw my theory of how the board is losing.  Eric
should have some Interlans to swap in.

CADR 8 crashed twice in an hour and a half.  (debugging from CADR4).
Note that 260 is the vector address for the keyboard.
I found the keyboard unibus channel is set up correctly
together with 260 as the vector address in the proper place (location 502).
So either the memory reference failed to read that word properly,
or the (JUMP-NOT-EQUAL MD A-B INTR-0) at INTR-0 plus 6 executed wrong.
MD was clobbered since that instruction so I can't tell which.
M-B does contain 260.

I restarted at INTR-0 minus one and stepped.  It worked properly this time.

sorry pat, but you're wrong. the history of bug-hardware has shown that it
is where general complaints about both labs' hardware (e.g. "MC dialups
don't work") goes, as there is no better list for making such complaints.
also, the people who used to be most prominent in fixing hardware fixed all
hardware, lispm and otherwise (moon, hic, and so forth). so people not
interested in lispms (e.g. ellen and gsb) are on BUG-HARDWARE to keep in
touch with users who don't know to ask them about non-lispm-hardware

I don't know who fixes those things (technical majik cards).  I hope it
isn't me.

I'm thinking of trying to debug one of those cards (like, on an extender
and all, and constantly reloading minits to drive people crazy), just to
see if there's a systemic improvement available, like interposing some 
resistors on the lines to prevent flameouts.

I tried swapping CADR-1's and CADR-5's drives, because CADR-5 was getting
continual disk errors, and I needed to use it this afternoon.  I also swapped
the packs.  CADR-1 booted up happily on CADR-5's drive, but CADR-5 got infinite
disk errors on CADR-1's drive.  Swapping packs (CADR-5 with CADR-5's drive and
CADR-1's pack) made CADR-5 happy, thus showing the problem to be with the pack.
I took CADR-25's old pack and formatted it; it seems to win.  So flush the
service call on that drive.

1- It locked up in the middle of running, and when you tried to
boot it wen on for 2-3 seconds and then locked up again.
looking at it upstairs, I noticed that when you tried to boot
it it did a lot of disk io and then stopped with the numbers
in the leds all 8s.  This happend repeatably.

2- I turned the disk drive off, and as it was about to stop the belt
between the motor and the disk spindle came off its pullies.
We cannot even experiment with the cpu until this problem is fixed.

All 8s is generally what you'll see when the machine is running, after it's
finished booting.  Some of the 8s will look slightly dimmer than others.  Of
course, it's possible that the machine was halted, and there was something
wrong with the PC display so that it showed all 8s.

    2- I turned the disk drive off, and as it was about to stop the belt
    between the motor and the disk spindle came off its pullies.
    We cannot even experiment with the cpu until this problem is fixed.

This won't be fixed until next week, because (I believe) John Holden, who
repairs our disk drives, is on his annual vacation.  You should tell Tom
Callahan about the drive, and he will have John Holden come and fix it as
soon as possible.

Swapping transceivers does not help.
The transceiver cable is mislabled HTVAX and it looks ok, but people have been pulling wires
in that area.
I can't log in, so I didn't bother looking further.

The only thing that I could find blatantly wrong with HTJR's connection
was that the cable had been pinched between two tiles- even though there
was a hole two inches away.  It didn't look too seriously mangled, just
a little row of black marks.  I put some electrical tape over it and ran
it through the hole just to make sure.  i thought that maybe the metal edge
of the tile was getting in close enough, perhaps even touching, the wires
so that there was a bit of leakage all the way across the wires.  Not enough
to break the connection but enough to even out the potentials enough so that
errors would occur.

The new mice are here, as promised, but their scale is slightly wrong -- it's a
little too fine.  Using a VMI monitor and the MIT system, the top of a chinual
no longer corresponds to a whole screen.  I tried bashing the second entries of
sys:mouse-x-scale-array and sys:mouse-y-scale-array to 1500 and 2300
respectively, and this seems to produce more or less the right results.
However, I wish there were a more aesthetic way of hacking this -- it would be
nice if there were a keyworded function for setting it (maybe
(tv:set-mouse-type ':purbrick) or (tv:set-mouse-type ':mouse-house)).

Usually a disk drive problem, maybe the disk controller.  I would'nt
worry about it unless it happens again; it could have been a glitch
that sent the drive off-line without spinning it down.

CADR-22 has a problem. It seems to think it has only 256K of memory.
It doesn't, though; it has 512K physically present. The problem looks
to me like one of the power strips on the upright post of the machine
isn't getting any power from the box. At least, its little yellow light
doesn't go on and the fan (which runs off that strip) doesn't spin. Can
you maybe look at the box which is supposed to be feeding that power 
strip and see what might have broken so the machine can work happily again?
Greg Faust said something about that someone was grumbling earlier today
about someone having overloaded Switched or UnSwitched power -- maybe two
cords were coming out of one instead of one out of each or something like
that. We're not too sure of the details on that, but it might be related.
Anyway, any help you can offer would certainly be appreciated. Thanks.

Cadr 24 died spontaneously while I was using it moments ago.
Curiously, the run bar was off and it just ignored all 
keyboard input.  Warm booting caused it to page a bit and
then die with the run light on.  It now refuses to cold 
boot.  After several attempts, it once it got as far as putting
up the lisp window before wedging.28-Sep-83 22:37:50-EDT,182;000000000000

  I had a very strange experience with cadr5 at 12:15 pm, 9/29/83.
  I was in an editor when the machine started beeping at me wildly,
just intermittently at first, but incresingly.  Actually, it was very 
nice that the machine gave me warning that it was going to die because
I had a chance to save my edit buffer.   Soon enough it was beeping continuously
and everything else seemed to stop working.  The beeping stopped, and the machine
would not respond to any keyboard input, including cold boot, though the mouse
still worked and the clock was still ticking.    At the physical
machine in room 905 (or whatever) a red led was blinking on the upper
right side of the dark panel.
  Returning to the console, I plugged in the keyboard from cadr24 and was able to
cold boot cadr5, even though no other keyboard input seemed to get through, 
including warm boot.  
  Now, everything appears to be normal, and I am typing this message on cadr5
with cadr5's original keyboard.   
There is something mysterious and wrong going on here.

I note that the Lisp machine terminal in Room 301 is powered down.  When
I tried to power it up, it took >10 mins to have any visible brightness
on it at all.  It stayed very dim, however, with the retrace lines
showing very strongly.  I suspect it's also disconnected at the patch
panel, since it did not respond to any keystrokes.  Is it known to have
some disease, or can it be fixed up to be usable?

oh come on carl, he never said they SHOULD get the mit equipment breakage
reports. but maybe if they DO get them for a week they will get around to
implementing SOMETHING that will make hardware bug reports from
symbolics-built machines go by default to some list of people who can do
something about fixing the said broken lispms, rather than to a list of
people interested in keeping ITSs, cadrs, tweneces, and vaxen working.  the
point in question is causing fixers of symbolics hardware to know when
symbolics machines here are hardwarily broken; alan's forwarding does that,
in a crude fashion which will tend to encourage them to improve on it.

if kerns wants to remove himself, fine; he probably gets too much mail
anyway.

Cadr12 has a problem where it will stop responding to chaos, i.e.
attempts to file serve it, finger it, status it, etc. think it is not
responding.  This is intermittent.  It has no problems sending things
over the chaosnet (except when it stops responding and the other end
of the connection thinks it has died and closes the connection) and
sending things out will revive it for a while.  Can anyone help us.

I am running LOD7, Symbolics release 4.3, System 222.296,
making heavy use of attached FPS-box (which appears quite
healthy).

CADR-4 (with attached CHROMA) has been inoperative for at
least two weeks.  I do not know what problems this machine
may have.

I am making heavy use of both of these machines right now,
and could use some assistance in getting both machines up

Thanks much,

I shut off the dover spooler because the alto running spruce could not

At the time it this happened, the dover itself was producing very poor
output -- the paper was smeared with toner and fuser oil, and had a
tendecy to jam.

So, what's the story on the second dover?

That *is* the second Dover; the old one is in a crate downstairs
in the basement.  I heard someone decided it was irreperable, but
I am not sure if that is true or not.

Thanks to whomever repaired CADR-4 so quickly.
The users of Fellini's CHROMA are exceedingly
grateful.

CADR-6 unfortunately has not shown any signs
of life since its untimely demise three weeks
ago.  Any chance this problem might be solved
in the next few days?  If it appears not, I
would like to move the FPS-box and its
accompanying SPIRE band to another machine.

Would someone please send me a message about
the status of its repair?

Thanks again for getting CADR-4 back on the air.

Best regards,

John Amuedo

Specifically, it seems to have full power. I checked the breakers. They

A broken ALU was replaced on cadr6 a week or 2 ago.
Has it been crashing since then?  It seemd to be up all the
time.  If it does crash, people should include more information
in the bug report (ie what they were doing when it crashed).
I was using it 2 days ago  and it worked fine.  However I
did not use the FPS box.

Hmm. It was having continued troubles just now, but I noticed that in spite
of my inability to type to it, today the wholine seemed to have a live clock.
So it occurred to me that the console cord might simply be loose; I had already
tried booting the keyboard and it made noises like it had a good connection,
but I guess that isn't sufficient to know all the cables are in place because
indeed the connector to the keyboard in the back of the machine was a little
loose and when I tightened it, the machine started behaving normally. So it
seems to be fine now. If I find later that this wasn't the problem, I'll send
a fresh bug report.

you should include as much information as possible with any

CADR-6 has been down for over a month.  I have sent five
bug reports to BUG-HARDWARE with no response.  AKR suggests
CADR-6 "has been up all of the time" and that it "was used
two days ago".  This response is absurd.  I make heavy use
of this machine and the attached FPS box, as I explained in
my original message.  I have inquired weekly as to progress
related to its repairs, and there has been no response.  I
asked that I be informed if CADR-6 was likely to be down
for an extended period of time, so I could move the FPS box
to a working CADR.  It appears that whomever (if anyone) is
reading BUG-HARDWARE these days seems to have confused
CADR-6 with another machine.  I spend 8-10 hours daily near
its console, and have not seen it powered up in five weeks.
If an insumountable problem has been encountered in its
repair, I would appreciate a response so other arrangements
can be made.

Thanks,

Maybe someone should plug the power cord into cadr6's console
on the 7th floor, but cadr6 is certainly up as you can see:
(If the console is broken, you should send a message to bug-hardware
or tell Ron Wicken in 926 that the console is broken.)

CADR-6's console APPEARS to be O.K., except that someone
seems to have scavenged its keyboard.  Can it be replaced
by a working spare?

The console was unplugged WEEKS ago when I reported the
original problem.  I assumed that it would be reconnected
as soon as that problem was resolved.  Had someone sent
me mail to that effect, I would have gladly plugged in
CADR-6's console upon hearing the repairs were done.

Thanks for getting this machine back on the air, and for
responding to my last message.

John

Insert your description of the circumstances, and how often the problem occurs:

CADR 32 was running 97.28 microcode 257 and died in the midst of a 
(write) file operation surrounded by lots of flonum crunching. The
Garbage Collector was on. This has happened at least ten times under
similar circumstances (i.e, sometimes occurs after 10 file operations,
sometimes after two). ME can show you the (brief) source code for
the file stuff if that helps.

    CADR-6 has been down for over a month.  I have sent five
    bug reports to BUG-HARDWARE with no response.  AKR suggests
    CADR-6 "has been up all of the time" and that it "was used
    two days ago".

Whoah.  John, CADR-6 has indeed been up.  I've used it several times while
you've been sending these messages, and I have checked to see if it was up, and
it indeed always was up, just as Alex told you.  All I can figure out is that
maybe someone with an office nearby doesn't like the sound of the console and
has been disconnecting it.  What you should have done was try to plug in the
console, or finger the machine, or something besides sending increasingly
strident messages to Alex.  I think that probably the best thing you could have
done is go talk to him if you didn't understand why he was telling you it was
up when it seemed to be down.

Cadr15's disk is again going off line.  At the moment it doesn't seem to
be able to reboot the machine.  I will call John Holden this afternoon
to have him take a look at it.

Looks like cadr15 has inherited cadr16's drive lossage since,
unless I am confused, it was cadr16 that kept going off-line 
this past summer until one of the boards finally broke and was 
replaced by John Holden.
Maybe someone should mention that to him.  I wont be here later
this afternoon.

Re cadr16: I stuck 4 good memory boards into it last saturday, and
it was up until someone powered it down and moved it out of the 
machine room.

While debugging machine CADR-32, system 97.28 microcode 257. Either an

some cases is better than 50%. An example is

The first of the two answers, by the way, is the correct one.  
They each occur with about equal frequency, and there are many other
pairs of bignums that have a variable product. I dont think the 
problem is confined to arithmetic, but this is the only example
I have which is reproduceable. 

This problem is serious because a lot of people are using this machine 
and getting strange or inconsistent results, or worse still, results 
that they assume are correct which are not.

1) the black plastic of the MTA1 door has broken. the drive is usable
but caution must be observed. i called in DEC, they said they would
come in Tues. morning to look at it.

perhaps more importantly

2) there's a funny smell in the air in places. like a burned out
ballast in a fluorescent light. it's very strong in the ninth-floor
elevator lobby and the west-side hall (outside my office). but i was
on the seventh floor about 6:30am and noticed it there too. i poked
around the machine area up here but the smell was hardly noticeable
there, certainly didn't seem to be emanating from anything in
particular.  also, and perhaps associated, my office is cold (radiator
is blowing out unheated air) but over by MC it's warm. in other words,
maybe something is fried on the tenth floor.  of course, the smell and
the uneven heating/cooling may have separate causes (my office has
been cold all night, and i only noticed the smell in the past hour),
but it all should be looked into.

CADR 18 halted with a "micro stack parity error".
The micro stack pointer and the contents of the stack
all looked correct.
I tried proceeding and it halted the same way again.
I tried depositing the current stack pointer value
back into the stack pointer and then proceeded.  It ran.
This suggests that the parity error was in the micro stack pointer register.

Such a problem had happened to me once before.

Avatar died. I went upstairs and found the piece of clear acrylic that
is supposed to guard its front side only attached at one point and 
dangling at an odd angle. AKR looked it over and found a huge number
of bent pins, at least one of which was touching a ground it shouldn't
have been touching. Probably someone bumped or fell into the machine
causing the damage. If the cover had been securely in place, I'm not
convinced this would have happened, so remember if you open it to secure
it carefully. In any case, during straightening the bent pins, two broke
(one at a time of course). After patching around the first broken one, 
AKR and I decided it wasn't worth doing again on the second one (the
patch procedure is painful and messy) so we're leaving the machine down
until he or TC get a chance to fix it correctly -- probably tomorrow.

The 3600 version of the KBE is very recent (dumped yesterday) so should
suffice for any PA work in the meantime.

Hi. We just moved into 755 and think we're having line problems. 
There are two lines in the office, a plugbox and a line hanging from the

Should these lines be working? (i.e., have they never been installed, or
are they broken?) Before TLP left, he conveyed the impression that they

Not a line problem. The problem appears to be a combination of not

slot. We found a free one by swapping out someone who'd gone home.

The reason the new 7th floor offices don't have terminal lines isn't because
the lines aren't there, and it isn't because the serial cards aren't there
(yow!).  It's because a piece of technician work hasn't been done on the
concentrator rack to let us plug in another 16 lines.  It's not a whole lot
of work, but TC is in Hawaii, so it'll take some extra time for the
technician allocation to happen, because I have to find out who to allocate.

I added a new frame to the rack and reconfigured NE43-7A so there are now 16
more lines on it.  That means that the concentrator end now has all the lines
plugged into it.  Whether or not they reach the offices isn't my business,
but it looks to me like many do not.

If you should find that there is a bad port on the concentrator, please let
BUG-HARDWARE know.  Don't just go pulling lines out of one port and plugging
them into others (unless the others are already empty).  If your terminal
type is wrong, log in on MC and read your ttyloc (do a :finger to get it),
and send me a message with the ttyloc and the correct terminal type, and I'll
fix it.

There is a frotzed port on NE43-7A-HUB:  Top left corner of the lower
construct.  I have put a piece of yaller paper over it.  Of course, 
the right thing to do is reboot minits one dark and stormy night, 
then see whether that port cometh back.  Of course.

I'm on this list, and I did want to know.  That may be the board that you
gave me back after swapping boards on 9A for Buckley.  Was it the leftmost
port that occasionally screwed up on that board?  If so, I suggest we just
swap it with another board that I have and send that board back to TM and
tell them to give us another.

Cadr 2 does not respond to cold booting, either from the keyboard or
from the little button on the machine.

The grim scenario was as follows:
Someone had supdup'ed to mc.  I broke the connection and
attempted to booted the machine via the keyboard.  The clock stopped
and the cursor stopped blinking, but the two little lines
never appeared on the bottom of the screen.  The machine has
not been heard from since.

It appears (from the herald) that the microcode and band WERE 
compatible.

Thanks very much for all you work on the terminal wiring and so
forth; I think it will make a real difference in the day-to-day
quality of life.

Of course, there are always a few bugs... In particular, the
thinner of the two wires running from the 8A hub to 810 seems to
be dead.  (This is the one with the plastic tag around it at the
concentrator end; it is plugged into the 2nd socket down in the
rightmost column of 8A-hub sockets.)  I have gotten both
terminals in our office to work by using the thick wire in BOTH
of the sockets occupied by the two wires, so I am quite sure that
it is the connection wire that is dead and not the sockets or the
terminals.  However, when you come to our office you will see
that the thin wire is connected to a female AMP connector, while
the thick wire is connected to a male AMP connector.  Thus, I
cannot ascertain whether the hub-810 wire is faulty or whether
the AAA-AMP wire is faulty (or both).  Thus, I recommend bringing
another male-AMP-to-AAA connector when you check this all out.  I
have left our current AAA wire connected to the hub-810 wire; the
twosome is hanging on the front of the file cabinet next to our
terminals.

Thanks for fixing this whenever you manage to get to it,
	dan

P.S. The thin (faulty) hub-810 wire has no shell over the AMP
connector at the 810 end.  Perhaps you have a spare we could use?

P.P.S. I have left the cover plates off the back of both
terminals.

The USP was 1; 1@u was the correct return-address

Restarting at the same instruction with @G ^P made the machine

CADR-31 won't disk-save -- it wedges when one attempts a disk-save on it.  It
operates perfectly except for this, but, unfortunately, is next to useless if
we can't easily get up-to-date software on it.

This has been going on for months.  I would suggest swapping disks with
another machine to see if the problem goes away as a first cut.

When you have a broken mouse (I really need a file saying this on my
directory), take it up to John Purbrick's office, room 912.  He has a
workbench with two boxes of mice on it.  One contains broken mice, and the
other contains working mice.  Leave your broken mouse and take a working one.
Attach a note to the broken mouse describing the symptoms.

Cadr-23 is making very frequent arithmetic errors in bignum
arithmetic. I'm almost certain that this is due to conditional jumps
being missed. I tried replacing the machines 74S181's with 74AS181's,
but some of these may have been bad because it wouldn't get all the
way through booting with the new chips. I've heard from Taft and Dph
that its possible to ease this problem by slowing the machines clock.
Could you do this sometime ? 

N.B. This is the machine that has only one good band left on its pack.

single dialup user logged on now, which seems suspicious, and further
makes me think the problem is not at my end.

This animal has a bad power supply. It doesnt 
just go down, it goes out completely, no lights
on the panel, no flicker from the LED's on board.
Power cycling makes it go again. Are there any
spares ?

Boyoboyoboy are you in luck.  There are not one but TWO unused
backplanes in that closet.  It can get replaced soon.

But are you really sure it's the power supply?  Did you measure
voltages with the machine busted?  What is yur favorite color?

I found the keyboard on CADR2 to be ineffective and have switched it

The lispm was not responding to any characters typed.  No response to
C-M-C-M-Rubout.  I pulled the plug, waited a couple of minutes, and
powered it back on.  It sang its little tune, and the keyboard seemed
reset.  I booted it, but found it again frozen.  Another two on/offs,
the first with no effect, and the keyboard worked intermittently: it
would sing its reset tune every now and then, spontaneously, and there
seemed to be some spurious characters sometimes sent to the lispm.

These problems have been kicking around for some time, and really ought
to be fixed:

(a) CADR18 dies randomly.  We suspect the problem to be memory parity
error.  Rumour has it this is a relatively easily problem to fix.

(b) CADR5 has a bad CHAOSnet interface.  As of yesterday, it was working
intermittently, but would usually cause higher levels of the CHAOSNet
software to hang (usually when packets had to be acknowledged in a STS,
it seems).  The bad bits will become evident by running CHAOS:CHATST on
the machine.

(c) CADR8's keyboard does not seem to work.

(d) CADR9 has disappeared from the face of the earth, it seems, to be
transformed into CADR15, a namespace server for Symbolics software.
CADR9 was formerly used by the Music Group -- don't they want it back ?
Either the real CADR15 ought to be fixed, or, judging from the last ten
weeks of Bug-LispM mail, a site the size of MIT really ought to have a
3600 as a namespace server.

When I fixed Cadr15/9, a couple weeks ago, the memory board appeared
to be giving a data error without giving a parity error, so it went
undetected and caused other things to bring it to a halt when they
were given garbage to work with.  This was with the TI memory boards.
It may be something to watch out for, or it may have been a strange
case.  I didn't try to fix the TI board, so there is probably a memory
board around someplace that should be fixed (GLR might know where).

I also found lint-like dust in LM15 on the connectors inside the door,
and cleaning them off seemed to make it work better.  I suspect this
might help the other Cadrs as well.  It is less dusty over here, and
our two Cadrs tend to go about 3 months (i.e. 6 months per Cadr)
between diseases, and it's usually a wire wrap going bad or a memory
chip gone senile.

Nope, not quite.  CADR-4 is the general AI lab machine that was snarfed by
the music group, but everyone agreed it was okay if the music group didn't
have punt privileges on it.  CADR-9 was once in that position (years ago),
but Winston gave the music group the machine, so it really is theirs.

This machine is very flakey.  It seems to be a process parity error: testing
the machine elicits some errors in the shifter, but the memory tests seem to go
smoothly.

Here is a CC :MAIL diagnostic.  Sometimes, it will say ``processor parity
error.''

The ninth floor terminal concentrator died, and since I didn't know
how to fix them really, but since lots of people asked me about it, I
did the following things to get back the ports.

PDH and I got the old 3B concentrator working (it is full of plaster
dust from 3rd floor construction).  We then plugged every spare
terminal line we saw into 3B.

9A is still broken, but a port is a port, so this should do for now.
All ports were set to be AAA's by the way.

If anyone who knows how wants to try and fix 9A, I have spares.

So anyway, sorry for the inconvenience, even sorrier I couldn't fix
the damn thing.  Oh well, maybe hack at it tomorrow or something...
Somebody who knows how should really find me and hack it.
oh well.

The goddam VMS is broken!  The error with the tape drive was a loose
connector.  That has been fixed and SUNDAR made a niltape successfully
on it.  The present problem is strictly VMS's fault.  There has been
a similar idiocy with the printer:  It wakes up trying to run some process,
craps out and hangs, and will not release the printer to anybody.
Power-cycling did not help, and that tells me that nothing I know how to do
from the keyboard WILL help.

I know exactly nothing about repairing VMS software.  Please God and
the dogs of AI, for which I supposedly work, I shall never learn.
This is a DEC operating system, we have a service contract, let them
send out someone to fix it.  If we ran UNIX on that crock I would 
happily fuck with it.  We don't, I can't, I won't.

I think that there is some hardware lossage on 7A-HUB. Every once in a

I can't believe that this is due to load on OZ. The OZ load factor
today was about 6 when the most recent offense was perpetrated.

Subject: Subnet 6 lossage


I have removed TOTO and CADR27 from subnet 6.  It is getting flooded
with packets which seem to be coming from the file computer (CADR27).
To reporducibly destroy the subnet, go over to CADR27 and get a peek
window and click left on "HOSTAT".  The machine will wedge, and the
subnet will wedge as it sends endless packets.  You can try
warm-booting, but that doesn't always help.

In short, someone should look at CADR27.  I took TOTO off of 6 because
it cannot afford to crash with 45/60  users on NVTs.

I hope someone who is good at this sort of debugging will look closer
into it.

Subject: CADR's 4, 9 and 15
To: bug-hardware@MIT-OZ


It has become increasingly difficult for the people
working on speech and music-related things to make
progress with these machines out of commission, or
unusable for their original purpose.  Mike Riley,
Jim Davis, David Saslav and myself presently rely
on CADR's for our research, primarily because these
machines are capable of supporting the specialized
hardware that we own for such purposes (e.g., FPS
box and CHROMA's).  Until a graceful transition of
this hardware to 3600's can be made, I would like
to request the following:

  1. A working CADR be designated for connection
  to the workstation outside 702, for use with
  one CHROMA.  For reasons of minimizing cable
  length, this CADR need reside in the adjacent
  7th floor machine room.

  2. A working CADR (or CADR-9, if operational)
  be designated for reconnection to the FPS
  array processor to support a SPIRE workstation,
  as originally intended.  CADR-9's console seems
  to have evaporated from the "hammock alcove".

  3.A working CADR be designated for connection
  to the workstation in 702, for use with the
  CHROMA that is situated there.  This will
  require relocating the console attached to the
  present "namespace server".  Also for reasons
  of cable length, it is desirable that this
  machine reside in the 7th floor machine room.

Please let me know exactly what obstacles lie in
the path of restoring these machines to their
original working state.  I am making separate
provision to have the special hardware involved
moved onto 3600's, but this will likely not be
possible until June.

Sorry about the impersonal nature of this note.  I
don't know who is worrying about CADR maintenance
these days, so I don't know to whom this flame
should be addressed.  Please excuse the formality.

Thanks a lot,

To the LMI CADR repair cadre: you should know that

1) there is no reason why the music people ought to have any sort of
privileged access to any CADRs.  Not only in my opinion (since I do
not recognize such privileges), but according to the "official"
lab philosophy, whose criteria Amuedo does not meet.

2) his request seems to be an attempt to sneak past everyone
a demand for such privileges.

3) Amuedo has adopted a strong pro-slime bias which he professes even
to the point of pressuring other people he works with against use of
MIT software, even threatening to fire them.  When he discusses this
subject he takes a totally amoral attitude of cold realpolitik.
Even those things he is asking for which are not outrageous in
themselves (such as to put the machines he wants to use higher on the
queue) are still special favors, and his position makes him less
deserving than average of any favors from you.

4) The original working state of the machines in question is not
the same as the state he is requesting.

Conclusion:
You should not give Amuedo any special consideration.  There is no
particular reason to set up CADRs as or where he is asking; and if
CADRs happen to be set up in those ways, they are still not "designated"
for him or for the uses he makes of them.

I am sending this to bug-hardware because I believe that justice

I suspect that corwin may have a flakey chaos transceiver.  Every once
in a while, the machine hangs up;  the few times i've been able to do
enough to see anything at all, it was spending over 50% of its time on
the interrupt stack;  the chaosnet_ncp process accumulates some runtime,
but (i don't think) it's enough to account for how slow the machine gets.
Everything is always fine if there is no chaosnet_ncp process.

I don't think this is a software problem because it has never been documented
to occur on oberon, and did not on corwin until a few weeks ago.

My impression was that this is the symptom of some sort of network
problems. Avatar has had this same erratic behavior for many weeks now.
(To clarify, since we run Rel4.5, I mean real problems in Chaosnet itself,
not software problems such as the Rel5 network lossage. Perhaps some machine
is pestering Avatar incessantly or perhaps there is spurious noise on the
cable near Avatar or some such? I'm cc'ing this to some network people who
might be able to comment in a more informed way; I'm just guessing randomly)

David - I really would appreciate your looking at Cadr22.  I do not
think it is very likely to be a software (e.g. compiler) problem as it
dies at totally different places (i.e. different files) each time, but
always at the same PC location.  It may indeed be something of a
hardware nature that has to do with the network interface, as it is
reading files when it dies, or it may be some other hardware-related
problem.  As to KMP's message, we appreciate his sharing his hunch
with us, but this should not cause the problem not to be looking at by
people who know the Cadr hardware better.

Anyways, I have left the machine in its stuck state for you to look
at, and the error is easily reproducible.  Can we schedule a time
soon for it to get some attention?

David,

The chaos net is still broken to Cadr22 (and probably the Cadr
in 939).  I assume you saw GLR's long message about the condition
of subnet 6.  I would obviously like to see the cable fixed to Cadr22
or it moved to another net as soon as possible (it may then turn
out the previously evidenced hardware problem was in fact due
to the net as KMP surmised).

In any case, David, can you take care of getting Cadr22 reconnected to
the world?  I am not sure if this kind of thing was written into the
terms of the LMI service contract.  If not, I have separate funds
available to pay for whatever needs to be done, which I hereby
authorize.

Please let me know what you can do.

Dave -

Thanks to all those responsible for re-laying subnet 6 and thus
reconnecting Avatar to the world.  Unfortunately, the new net
connection has not caused Avatar's halting behavior to go away.  The
symptom is still the same -- it always stops at the same PC location,
but at unpredictable points in what it is running.  Hopefully, now
that the chaosnet is connected to it again, you will be able to
hardware debug it soon.  I will leave it in the halted state for you.
		Thanks, Chuck.

P.S. One experiment I haven't done, yet, but will try this afternoon
is to put it in an infinite do loop and see if it dies.  Currently, I
have been testing it with a Make-System, it tends to halt either
during a compilation or a loading (both of involve i/o).  It
has never run for longer than 5-10 minutes doing this.  You
will be able to tell from the monitor how it got into the
halted state. -CR

I don't think it is strictly a system bug --- probably

Well, I think I may have gotten to the bottom of things.
It does appear to be a problem with disk.  Whether it is
physical or not, I am still not sure.  Anyways, what I did
is copy the PAGE band from Cadr7 to Cadr22 (they were exactly
the same size), with the thought that this would guarantee
overwriting that sector of the disk with new (parity'ed)
bits.

About half-way through, I got the following error message:

>> Disk Write Error Unit 0, Cyl 80, Surf 0, Sec. 0

Status Header-Compare
       Transfer Aborted

(the address being written to was 25840).

I retried the disk write several times and it kept failing.  The
first several retries, changed the Sec number to 3 and then 4, but
then it stayed at 4. Whether this is actually a damaged disk, or a
formatting problem, I don't know.  Obviously, the first thing
to try is to reformat the disk.  The old disk is on top of
Cadr22's drive.  However, before you do that for us, I want
to double check with Dick and KMP.  I don't think there is anything
there we can't lose, but Dick won't be back until next Monday.
I will send you a message then to confirm.

Meanwhile, I seem to be computing along ok with our backup
disk (glad we invested!).  I will let you know if problems
re-appear, but I hope they won't.

Dave -
The bad disk that used to be in Cadr22 and is now sitting
on top of it's disk cabinet can be reformatted now.
I don't personally know how to do this.  Are our relations
with you/LMI good enough to have this done by you or
your minions?  

		Thanks, Chuck.

P.S. Here is the disk diagnostic message

P.P.S. Does reformatting include a check of the entire

circuitbreaker tripped. according to the fault lights, the problem was AIR
FLOW CPU. JNC and I found the correct circuit breaker (on the inside of the

it provided the correct effect of letting the machine come up again. we
left the door open because it's a bitch to close, also because one of the
fans on the top of that cabinet isn't working. i believe Our Man Lester
knows that fan is a loser and just hasn't gotten around to fixing it.  for

Subject: Advice on Broken Cadr22

TWIMC - Let me first apologize for the wide net of recipients
to this message.  I am not sure who should actually be able
to help fix broken Cadr's (possibly no one), but I am at least
looking for advice from someone.

A pattern of disk errors has developed with Cadr22.  A month
or two ago it would randomly die (requiring cold boot).  The
problem was tracked down to a disk error in the PAGE band.
The error was easily manifest by trying to copy the PAGE
band to itself.  Part way through, the following error occurs,
from which it will not recover.

    >> Disk Write Error Unit 0, Cyl 80, Surf 0, Sec. 0

    Status Header-Compare Transfer Aborted

    (the address being written to was 25840).

On the theory that the disk media was at fault, we switched
to a new disk and had no problems until today.  Today, a similar
phenonemon is happening.  I tried

(DISK-COMPARE 'CADR22 'PAGE 'PAGE)

and lo and behold, the following similar error:

Error: Disk Read-Compare Error Unit 0, Cyl 23, Surf 18, Sec. 4

Status ECC-Soft Transfer Aborted

(the address being written to was 7735).

===> obviously something is wrong and it ain't software.  Can someone
with the requisite experience volunteer to take a look at this?  (It is
very reproducible).  If not, can anyone suggest if it makes sense to
order service on the disk drive (which we can at least get), or is
this clearly something wrong in the Cadr (e.g. the disk controller)?

				Thanks, Chuck.

This poor terminal (the AAA in NE43-705) is still not well.  I keep
having to adjust the pot at the far left corner of the horizontal PC
board inside the box.  There's no single setting for the pot which works
properly regardless of whether the terminal is warmed up or not.  I can
usually get it right if I fiddle with it but then if I leave it for a
day or so it gets out of whack again.  I'll try to leave it on and see
if it reaches a stable state, but I don't think that's a good long-term
solution since eventually it will be turned off for one reason or
another, so I'll either have to take the thing apart again at that time
or simply not put it back together (my current solution), neither of
which is convenient.

Could this terminal be swapped for one that works a little better?  Thanks.

John Holden gave the T-300 on Cadr22 the complete go-over, and it was
indeed very dirty and out of alignment (boy is he a pro!).  As
predicted, the machine cannot make it through cold boot now, probably
because it cannot read its own old disk pack.  There is nothing on
the currently loaded pack which I need, so it can be reformatted.

In order to reformat, however, I need to use another Cadr through the
debugging cables.  David, are the cables still hooked up from Cadr22
to another machine on the 9th floor?  If so, can you tell me which
one, where it is located, and if I need a key to get to it?
Alternatively, if it is not too much trouble for you, (i.e. the cables
are hooked to a machine you will logged into anyways) can I persuade
you to run the formatting procedure for me?  If you just copy over any
working band, so I can boot, I can take care of the rest using
Edit-Disk-Label from there myself.

			Thanks, Chuck.

	Seems like bogosity in the VMS CHAOS layer that allowed them
to get faked out by this. Since the IO-11 wasn't sending routing
packets on subnet 6, they should automatically have routed to subnet
3 via subnet 1. That's what you get for having wired in entries in
routing tables.

Most obvious symptom:

No, (and I mean zero) mouse feedback.

Current Solution:

I cold-boot the machine with meta-control-meta-control-rubout, which
allows me to use the machine without any problems that I have seen.

Additional Info:

No messages are displayed at the time of arrival at the site. i.e., no
garbage-collection messages, etc. just the standard herald.

The 7A concentrator just died again, and it took several tries to
reload and reboot.  If heat in that closet is in fact the problem, the
fan hack isn't working.  I suspect that all the cables around the
machine keep air from cooling it off.

We have had a 3600 for several years that has always had problems with

We discovered that one of the screws attaching the 120vac line to the

overheating and sparking.  We suspect that many of our previous halts
were do to this (after fixing the problem there haven't been any).

Better check to see if your screws are loose too!

Axe has been stopping about every 5-10 pages, apparantly because it

paper path sensor.

It also has a bad contact on the carriage, so that when the carriage is

not warm yet.

Maybe there's a big spike going down the line when you power-cycle the vt52.
My suggestion is that you get Joe Ricchio to fix it (he works for LCS, not
us, but maybe he'll do it anyway).

The probable reason is that the VT52 sends break when it's power-cycled.
Given that we now have reliable DLV11-J cards in the Hubs instead of
shitty Tech Magic cards, terminals attached to certain ports will
reliably crash the hub.

Well, about a month ago I checked all the cards in 8a, 8b, and 8c and made
sure that console halt was disabled.  It really was.  Have new cards been
installed in 8a?  Maybe the problem is with new cards; they come configured

Apiary-6 [Fep1] unexpectedly died today with numerous Irrecoverable Disk Errors.

I reset the Fep, but to no avail.  

I then went upstairs, power cycled the Eagles and the 3600's. Again, to no 
good result.  I noted that the two green lights we out [behind or next to the
power supply] on the suspect Eagle.  I also noticed that [unlike other eagles] that
units Run and Ready Lights would go out when I would power cycle the 3600 processor.
I've never noticed that sort of thing...generally, the Eagles' Run Lights seem
independant of the main processing unit.

Anyway, after countless retries I finally managed to boot Apiary 6 by hand without
the Disk Sector n-1 Not Found or Too Many Sectors [?] error.

Do you think someone should look at this? or is this just an extention of the
current problem with the FEP??

Thank you for looking into this matter:

Yes, either solution will work. I have already done the former since

ps: cranking up the voltage is a trivial operation, but you have to turn

The image on Jimi's monitor has been quite fuzzy.

I thought this was caused by the extreme length of the cable running to the
monitor.  I have thus switched monitor's between Jimi and Moon.

As a result:

1) The monitor which is now on Jimi is clear, however the vertical lines are
   a bit uneven.  (In addition, it takes about a minute for the monitor to fall
   into synch once it has been powered on).

2) The monitor now on Moon seems to be a bit fuzzy and the contrast does not
   seem very strong.  

Finally, the extra monitor sitting in Jerry Roylance's office (741) does not
appear to be receiving a proper synch signal.  Instead the image is shifted
half a screen horizontally.

Looks to me like this is the same thing that was happening yesterday
evening at around 8.  I don't think it is AI's problem.  It looked to me
then like subnet 6 was broken.  The symptoms were different than when AI's
tranceiver stopped working the other day: then I couldn't reach any other

There are now two busted 3600 cables that run from just outside my office

use a fresh cable run between Keith Moon and the monitor outside my office
everything is fine, but using either of the installed cables the monitor
seems to have no horizontal sync.  I had a hard time finding one of the
ends of the cables in the machine room, so for our future convenience I
have labeled both ends of both cables (one is 723P, the other is 723Q).

If somebody could fix the connectors on one or both of these cables, or run
a new one, I would appreciate it.

In case anybody was confused about why I am recomending a program
called TCPSPL for a chaos-only machine....

TCPSPL is a LPTSPL clone that can handle two kinds of printers: tty
printers (like an LA120), and remote printers via the unix lpd
protocol.  If somebody were to hack the TCP code to use Chaosnet
instead (which should be trivial), you could use this spooler to let
OZ spool to Pravda and LeMonde, if such things amuse you.  Ask me if
you want more details.

This was an unsollicited non-political announcement.

microcode TMC5-IO4-MIC 319, FEP 22, on Lisp Machine Duane Allman:

I don't know whether or not this is a hardware bug, but on all of the other
lisp machines I've used, when multiple mouse buttons are pressed simultaneously,
the sum of the button values appears in tv:mouse-last-buttons, with 1=left,
2=middle, 4=right.  On Duane, each value works correctly when pressed individually,
but if any two are pressed at once, the value is 1, even if the middle and right
buttons are pressed together.

Is this a 3670 "feature", or a hardware or software bug?

Thanks,

    I managed to set the current band on Cadr-8 to a band that won't boot.
The debugging cable for Cadr-8 runs to Cadr-4, which is not up and looks
like it is missing some boards; thus I can't use the debugging cable to
set the current band on Cadr-8 to something more reasonable.

    Sorry about all this.  The band that ran properly on Cadr-8 is LOD3,

    Terminal concentrator 8D is losing very badly. At frequent
    intervals (e.g. every couple of EMACS lines) response dies
    for a half minute or more.  This phenomenon occurs on multiple
    terminals connected to various different machines.

The problem was a line running open and generating garbage at 9600 baud.
This seems to happen a lot.  Laurel, you might want to tell your line runners
(yow, do you have a football team yet?) not to connect lines that don't have
anything on the other end to concentrators.  This doesn't matter on the
mainframes much, because it's easy to spy on other channels and see what
they're doing and set their baud rates to 0 if necessary, but the
concentrators don't know how to do this, so they get very slow.

The guilty line was marked `206' (bizarre place to talk to).

Symptoms: if I halt the machine by typing hyper-shift-function, then type "boot" to
the FEP prompt, the boot procedure begins normally.  However, the machine hangs
forever when it gets to the command "Clear Machine" and does not respond to any
keyboard input.  Sometimes the red fault light on the main processor is illuminated
at this point.  In order to unwedge the machine, I have found it necessary to push
the reset button on the main processor.  After this has been done, the machine can be
normally booted through the sequence "hello" and "boot".  Once booted successfully,
the machine seems to perform perfectly.

It ignores some input from the keyboard,

Since Hurewicz is still broken after 4 weeks,

Would it be possible for the area around Duane Allman to be cleaned up a

the cables are hooked into it. Fleck told me the cables going to it are
too short, so it isn't being used. Why not make longer cables? Or
instead, should we just leave the box hanging on the wall, unused? I
also think that the apple printer could probably be put in a better
place. Right now it is right behind the lisp machine terminal, about 5
inches from where you sit. It isn't very pleasant having the thing
printing away while you are trying to work. Does anyone have any ideas
where it could be moved?

	This is not a bug. The machine has no boot card in it. You have to
load it over the console serial line from the timesharing machine. I have
asked people in the AI Lab to provide a boot card, but nobody's interested.

Do you have any idea when it'll work, or is there another one, somewhere?

Paul,

Hurewicz's disk is apparently fucked up again.  The machine crashed
twice in the last two days, today because of "Disk hardware or microtask
hung" error.  See the bug log on the table in 902.  If you can't
identify the problem, couldn't you try replacing the disk or something?
Its really frustrating to lose hours of work due to an unreliable
machine.  Thanks.

     Maybe or maybe not.  We already have the "LA120 User Guide"
(EK-LA120-UG-004).  What we're looking for is the "maintenance manual"
or "service manual" or "technical manual" that tells us how to fix the
things.  We're having problems with a pair of LA120's which keep
breaking down every few weeks, and we'd like to borrow the manual long
enough for us to figure out if there's some subtle point about their
repair that we're overlooking.

     One place we know this manual should exist is in the microfiche
set which DEC publishes to cover all the hardware they sell.
Unfortunately, we're not sure if anybody at MIT has such a fiche set
or not.  A hardcopy version would also be useful (easier to read).

     In any case, thanks for responding.  We'd appreciate it if you
could forward this message to anybody who might be able to help us.

 Wronski (rm. 745) is receiving irrecoverable disk search errors every few minutes.
This occurs whenever I do much in the way of file transactions.  On top of the
monitor are two sheets of paper showing the results of :Show Status for two
crashes.

Some imbecile seems to have spilled coffee on the keyboard/mouse of this
machine (Brook Taylor, 7th floor, near the TV).  The "k" is sticky, as
are the middle and right keys on the mouse.  I would appreciate it if
someone could check it out.  Thanks.
