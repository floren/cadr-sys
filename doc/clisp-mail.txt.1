If you get this messge, you are on the LispM-Clisp list, which is a
temporary list for reporting progress on the Common Lisp implementation
for the MIT Lisp Machine system.  Since some of the Common Lisp changes
(even some of the trivial ones) can have important implications on the
system internals, it's a good idea to let others know what you've done
to them.  Also, all messages will be sent to SRC:<L.DOC>CLISP-MAIL.TXT.
So, there will be a place that you can refer to when documenting the
changes for users.

I have put about 200 new symbols in SYS:SYS2;GLOBAL LISP >, all of which
are needed for Common Lisp.  It includes most symbols that are
mentioned in Chapters One through Nineteen (that is, up to the Streams
chapter), but not all.  Most of the vector and general sequence function
names have not been added.  Just because a symbol has been added doesn't
have to mean that its function (or value) will be implemented ``soon,''
it has just been done so that not as many incremental updates to 
SYS:SYS2; GLOBAL have to be done.  Also, it means that new Common Lisp
features that appear in patches for systems 95 and up will not have to
have calls to GLOBALIZE in their patch files.

The file OZ:SRC:<L.DOC>CLISP-GLOBAL-SORTED.TEXT contains a sorted list
of the new global symbols.  When System 95 emerges, some version of this
should be in the System Release Notes.

The file OZ:SRC:<RPK.LM>CLISP-GLOBAL0.TEXT contains a list of the
symbols in the order I added them, which is pretty much that of their
appearance in the manual.  There are also notes on any possible screws
or needed changes that would have to be made (just having to do with
symbols, not feature implementation).

One incompatible change that Common Lisp will require is the TIME
function.  In Common Lisp, it's a special form that prints out timing
information on its body to *TRACE-OUTPUT*

Should this be handled with the -*-Common-Lisp:T-*- hack or should we
notify users of the change when System 96 or whatever rolls around ?
Remember that there are a few system functions that use (TIME), like
PROCESS-SLEEP, if I'm not mistaken.

You can find the list of the particular ones I added in
SRC:<RPK.LM>COMMON-GLOBAL1.TEXT.  It pretty much covers Chapter 20
through the end of the manual.  An updated list of all the new globals
is in SRC:<L.DOC>CLISP-GLOBAL-SORTED.TEXT.

The function TIME must continue to work in its current uses.
If it is possible to support the common lisp meaning as well,
that should be done; otherwise, common lisp loses.
