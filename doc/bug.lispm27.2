	zwei:*host-for-bug-reports* is supposed to be a host, not a string.
	Many other people have reported this, but apparently our replies haven't
	hit everybody.  Therefore, I am sending this to LispM-Uses.

    I've found it helpful to have an extended command in ZMAIL that changes the
    mail host.  It's very helpful when the mail host goes down or when it's
    too busy to accept incoming mail (MC does that a lot).  The vanilla world
    should have such a thing.

I guess I don't know what this has to do with
zwei:*host-for-bug-reports*.  There is another variable which forces
mail to go through a particular host.  I'm sorry, but if you want to set
that, you will have to live with it and distribute yoru tool to your
friends.  I don't think something like it will go in the system because
mail sending cooperates with the namespace system to find SOME
store-and-forward mailer that is up.  We sometimes have 3 of our 5 or 6
mailers down at the same time, yet mail still gets through because the
namespace is able to find a mailer that is up.  There shouldn't be any
need for your tool.

For the applications you have in mind (mail host down or busy), I really think
you want this set to NIL, so that ZMail will work to find another mailer.  If
you do need it for some reason, use it as a temporary measure.  Setting it in
your init file is an easy way to get confused later.  I guess I don't believe
that you need to set it often enough to write a supporting command.

I've seen this happen to me too. It seems that LOADED-BAND-NAME can only
be so many characters long. The fep file probably has the line 
"LOAD WORLD FEP0:>Release-5-2-prime.load.1" in it, and the part of the
name of the band is truncated to "FEP0:>Release-5-2-prime.load."
This indeed is a bug, but I worked around it by changing my fep files to
not have the ".1" at the end of the band name.

System 98 has a microcode bug that wedges the Chaos Net.
Doing a hostat is the easiest way to wedge the net.

MIT users should use Systems 94,97 or 99 in the mean time.

Note that cadr2 and cadr23 on the 7th floor do not have
enough working Control Memory to run system 99.

I saw this once when we still had the machine at SCRC.  I had hoped that
swapping a memory board fixed it.  It is probably a hardware problem.

This could be caused by a bit in the stack getting set spuriously.  I think someone
said that you had field service replace a bad DP board; this sounds like the spare
was bad, too, or there is so more systemic problem with the machine.

	To:   bug-lispm%MIT-OZ@MIT-MC.ARPA
	Subject: System 98


	System 98 has a microcode bug that wedges the Chaos Net.
	Doing a hostat is the easiest way to wedge the net.

The bug does not appear to be in the microcode. 
The problem is with the new site files (ie. the other new
Namespace problems).  Specifically, some unix hosts (to wit, 
MIT-APHRODITE don't seem to have gotten compiled properly.
The sign of this is things like [Unable to change the flavor of site ....]

What this means is that (send (si:parse-host "aphrodite") :send-if-handles
   :chaos-address) returns NIL, and sending it the message :chaos-address
of courses gets an error.  However, sending the message :network-addresses shows
the correct chaos address.   Since this is fixed in a later release, I made
a simple kludge which causes HOSTAT and similar functions to work.
The file to load is oz:ps:<x.hdt>fix-hostat.qfasl   
I did not bother to install this for several reasons.

Reply-To: SAZ@MIT-OZ


Could someone explain to me how I am supposed to wake the 3600's
supdup connection if I have typed ahead all pertinent login info
and wish to retain my prompt for the first sysmsg?

e.g.;

connect to host: oz
(screen clears and subliminal AI Lab cruft appears, to be replaced by
new cruft and pertinent downtime or disk space notifications, followed
by a prompt)
@ <--- cursor sits at position indicated, even though I have typed "saz password"
       ahead of time.  It is only after I type a space bar or some other char
       that the uname and password are output to the screen (ie, to the command
       processor).  But that space bar I typed in to force out the chars in 
       typeahead is still there!  The command proc. parses it as soon as it is
       finished logging me in, such that the following brain-dead scenario
       occurs:

@saz 
[PCL COMMAND DEFINED]
fortune message:  Good evening, saz...
                    Man does not live by bread alone -- he must also have dough for the weekends.
Zippy message:  Has Tellulah Bankhead taken out the cat yet?  Or is this a dream?
[End of LOGIN.CMD]
--Msgs-- <---Where I would LIKE the cursor to be right now...but now!  the space bar is now parsed.
(screen clears) (!!!)
First sysmsg appears, asking me if I'd like to see
--More-- <---Final position of cursor.

I hope I have outlined the situation clearly.  I am now going to log out and reestablish
a connection trying various ascii and non-ascii LM chars to see if they work.  It would
be nice to know exactly why I have to search for a kludgey solution.

No.  You are missing the point:  FUNCTION C-C SHOULD ONLY EFFECT THE
PORTION OF THE TYPEOUT WINDOW THAT IS EXPOSED.  The Zmacs window pane
underneath has no idea that someone inverted part of it.  That you can
recover from the bug is nice, but it does not fix the bug.  I didn't try
REFRESH, but Function REFRESH does work, and c-L leaves a turd at the
very bottom of the Zmacs window pane.

Subject: supdup
To: bug-lispm@MIT-OZ



When supdup'ing from a 3600 to a unix-running vax (i.e. prep),
after the first screen of data, the first character on each line
starts to disapear as soon as the newline character
is received.

i.e., while the first character if each line is printed,
it is erased when the cursor moves down to the next line.

This happens on both prep and mit-vx.

The problem goes away for one screen full if you do a clear.

Try it, you'll see what I mean.

    No.  You are missing the point:

Yup, I'm so used to this behavior that I could not see it as a bug until my
nose was rubbed in it (yechh, what a repulsive concept that mixed
metaphor suggests).
				     FUNCTION C-C SHOULD ONLY EFFECT THE
    PORTION OF THE TYPEOUT WINDOW THAT IS EXPOSED.

Right, that is the crux of the matter.  I just looked into it and it turned
out to be trivial to fix.  You'll probably see the correct behavior in
release 6.

In the same vein, 3600's don't supdup to [mit-project-athena] 750's
running Berkly 4.2 [plus many athena specific system modifications].
All kinds of control characters get printed to the screen.

	From: Christopher R. Eliot <CRE @ MIT-MC>

	The font change functions (e.g. C-X C-J) in Zwei put the font change indicators
	in the wrong place.

	;;; -*- Fonts: CPTFONT,CPTFONTB,CPTFONTI -*-
	.fi
	Foo Bar
	1baz
	0.nf

    It wasn't intended to be used this way.

Perhaps not, but it's awfully handy.

	      The reason the 0 is on the next line is that the font is only
    changed when it has to be.

    I guess it wouldn't hurt very much to make Zwei return to font 0 at the
    end of every line when writing a fonted file, 

Seems to me that the right thing is a generalized lookahead across
whitespace -- <Space> characters are often inserted in the current font,
whichever it was, so the font info attached to them should not be
regarded as significant (? at least this should be an option).  The idea
is that if you're changing back to the previous font (*, which, if
you're not generating, you should be), the change happens before the next
whitespace; otherwise, it happens after, so 

  Font->  000?111?000      (? -> irrelevant)
  Char->  the foo bar

gets written out as

  the 1foo* bar

i.e. the font switches get wrapped immediately around "foo" regardless
of how much whitespace appears on either side of it.

While you're at it, how about bringing Zmacs into line with every other
multi-font editor in the world (well, every one I've ever seen), and
take the font for self-insertion from the character to the left (except
at the beginning of a paragraph, where you take the character
immediately to the right), except immediately after a
change-current-font command?  This behavior seems pretty universally
regarded as within epsilon (sorry) of DWIM.  (Now if you could only do
something similar for the fill column and the fill prefix!  Alas, the
limitations of pure-character-stream editors...)

BTW, Zmacs in both Release 5.1 and System 98.78 have a bug that if you
have two windows, and one window's buffer has multiple fonts and the
other doesn't, then if you switch windows (c-X O or mouse-left) from the
fonted window (the top, let's say) to the bottom, the current-font
information does not get removed from the mode line.  Conversely, if by
switching buffers in the bottom window, you get the mode line to be
correct, then when you switch back to the top window the font
information does not reappear.  If I remember correctly, in 5.1 this
lossage even propagates across multiple ZMACS-FRAMEs.  I wrote a patch
for 5.1 for this problem -- get Phill Apley at Bitstream to give you a
tape (alas, they have no modems).

I see.  FEP0:>Release-5-2-Bulletin.load. is a string exactly 32
characters long, which is the maximum string allocated for this variable
in Release 5.  (Please don't try to change it; the FEP has to be able to
store into it.)  In Release 6, this string has a length of 64, which is
sufficient for a fully loaded name (max 32), type (max 4) and version
(realistically small), and even a short directory name.  Rename the file
to 
	FEP0:>Release-5-2-Bull.load.1

I had Mark Robbins replace the DP board way back when the garbage
collector didn't work, and then the garbage collector worked. I just
looked in the log book, and he didn't record the fact that he replaced
the DP board. The only record in the log book is the one for final
factory inspection. I will have him replace the DP board again, and
watch the machine to see if it flakes again, as the current bug is only
intermittent.

It sounds like the problem with spurious meter-function-exit traps is known
to have occurred on that machine two different DP boards (the one it had
at SCRC before it was called REAGAN, and the one that Mark Robbins put in
to fix the GC).  This decreases the probability that the problem is the DP
board.  On the other hand, since the logbook did not say that the DP board
was replaced, perhaps that is not what was actually done to make the GC work.
It would help to check the clocks and the power supplies, and then to swap
all the processor boards, including the DP, one at a time.  I would start
with the SQ.

    When supdup'ing from a 3600 to a unix-running vax (i.e. prep),after the first screen of data, the first character on each line
    starts to disapear as soon as the newline character
    is received.

    i.e., while the first character if each line is printed,
    it is erased when the cursor moves down to the next line.

    This happens on both prep and mit-vx.The problem goes away for one screen full if you do a clear.

    Try it, you'll see what I mean.

pertain to MIT machines. Please perform them in a timely manner, or let

This is a long standing bug in the 20X SUPDUP server that was discussed
in December '82, probably on Bug-OZ.  ITS has a similar problem, but has
a much much narrower timing window.

    Reply-To: SAZ@MIT-OZ


    Could someone explain to me how I am supposed to wake the 3600's
    supdup connection if I have typed ahead all pertinent login info
    and wish to retain my prompt for the first sysmsg?

    e.g.;

    connect to host: oz
    (screen clears and subliminal AI Lab cruft appears, to be replaced by
    new cruft and pertinent downtime or disk space notifications, followed
    by a prompt)
    @ <--- cursor sits at position indicated, even though I have typed "saz password"
	   ahead of time.  It is only after I type a space bar or some other char
	   that the uname and password are output to the screen (ie, to the command
	   processor).  But that space bar I typed in to force out the chars in 
	   typeahead is still there!  The command proc. parses it as soon as it is
	   finished logging me in, such that the following brain-dead scenario
	   occurs:

    @saz 
    [PCL COMMAND DEFINED]
    fortune message:  Good evening, saz...
			Man does not live by bread alone -- he must also have dough for the weekends.
    Zippy message:  Has Tellulah Bankhead taken out the cat yet?  Or is this a dream?
    [End of LOGIN.CMD]
    --Msgs-- <---Where I would LIKE the cursor to be right now...but now!  the space bar is now parsed.
    (screen clears) (!!!)
    First sysmsg appears, asking me if I'd like to see
    --More-- <---Final position of cursor.

    I hope I have outlined the situation clearly.  I am now going to log out and reestablish
    a connection trying various ascii and non-ascii LM chars to see if they work.  It would
    be nice to know exactly why I have to search for a kludgey solution.

	In the same vein, 3600's don't supdup to [mit-project-athena] 750's
	running Berkly 4.2 [plus many athena specific system modifications].
	All kinds of control characters get printed to the screen.

This sounds like the thing called SUPDUP on the vax isn't really SUPDUP
because it is violating protocol left, right and sideways.

    Was this with SUPDUP over TCP or SUPDUP over CHAOS?

    I wasn't able to reproduce this in the latest system SUPDUPing to CHARON
    using Chaos.

Assuming CHARON is representative, I guess my that conjecture isn't
valid.

Yes.

Actually, it was not gratuitous.  The release 5 TCP gateway stuff died a
natural death, succumbing to changes in the network system.  We finally
got rid of it so that people wouldn't expect it to work and be
disappointed.  The version supplied with TCP has been modified to be
compatible with real TCP and had lots of other bugs fixed.  Having all
of the TCP- and Internet-related code in one system has made maintenance
much simpler.

I would hope that MIT will buy TCP so that it can talk TCP directly.  We
certainly had a lot of interest on the recently concluded beta-test.  I
don't believe that the price is excessive considering what you get.

    Namespace Server, on Lisp Machine Ronald Reagan:

    Well, I recently changed PREP from a UNIX to a UNIX42.
    I was hoping that the Namespace system wouldn't lose this badly.
    This machine is the primary server for the MIT namespace, yet 
    It has forgotten all information about PREP from the MIT
    namespace object MIT|PREP, and only knows about INTERNET|PREP
    now. DEGAS and CEZANNE are broken in the same way.
    *SIGH*

    >>Error: PREP does not support LOGIN in a reachable way.
    While in the function NET:INVOKE-SERVICE-ON-HOST  TELNET:GET-LOGIN-CONNECTION  (:METHOD TELNET:NVT-WINDOW :CONNECT)

I did some minor surgery on Reagan and fixed this.  This sort of problem
shouldn't happen with release 6.

    	In the same vein, 3600's don't supdup to [mit-project-athena] 750's
    	running Berkly 4.2 [plus many athena specific system modifications].
    	All kinds of control characters get printed to the screen.

    This sounds like the thing called SUPDUP on the vax isn't really SUPDUP
    because it is violating protocol left, right and sideways.

        Was this with SUPDUP over TCP or SUPDUP over CHAOS?

        I wasn't able to reproduce this in the latest system SUPDUPing to CHARON
        using Chaos.

    Assuming CHARON is representative, I guess my that conjecture isn't
    valid.

Well, there are a number of things here that seem to be confusing
people. First of all, only three of four (possibly five) Athena
machines are actually on the Chaosnet.  Charon is one of them, and
thus is not representative.  Also no Athena machine supports Internet
SUPDUP.  Finally, as we all know the unix SUPDUP support is pretty
pathetic, although the stuff running on the Athena machines on the
Chaosnet is no worse than what you find on many other Unix's.

On the issue of garbage on the screen -- if it is typing lots of ^@ 's
at you, try telling unix "stty nl0".  It also gets confused if
overstriking is turned off.

the specific lossage came about by trying to compile a form like

i expect this but since condition-case expands into some kind of COND, the
actual error message being about an error in the body of a COND could potentially
be confusing.

    I understand why the namespace servers for the namespaces SCRC, ARPANET,
    INTERNET, SCRC, SCH, SWW, and SPA don't allow randoms at MIT to make
    changes to them, but the current system of us having to ask someone over
    at SCRC to make changes in their spare time is is hardly optimal. I have
    asked for some of these changes more than a week ago. These changes only
    pertain to MIT machines. Please perform them in a timely manner, or let
    us have some mechanism for doing them here.

In release 6 there will be a machanism to declare a host a secondary for
all namespaces.

    host INTERNET|MIT-PREP:	change system type to UNIX42

    host ARPANET|MIT-PREP:	change system type to UNIX42

    host INTERNET|MIT-VAX:	change system type to UNIX42

    host ARPANET|MIT-VAX:	change system type to UNIX42

    host INTERNET|MIT-HERMES: change system type to UNIX42

    host ARPANET|MIT-HERMES: change system type to UNIX42

    host INTERNET|MIT-VAX:	change system type to UNIX42

    host ARPANET|MIT-VAX:	change system type to UNIX42

    host INTERNET|MIT-HTVAX: change system type to UNIX42

    host ARPANET|MIT-HTVAX: change system type to UNIX42

    namespace INTERNET:	add REAGAN as a secondary 

    namespace SCRC:		add REAGAN as a secondary 

All done.

    namespace SCH:		add REAGAN as a secondary 
			    remove POLAR as a secondary

    namespace SPA:		add REAGAN as a secondary 
			    remove POLAR as a secondary

    namespace SWW:		add REAGAN as a secondary 
			    remove POLAR as a secondary

These are harder because they run release 5.2 software.  I'll work on
them.

Subject: A message from Goldy
To:   bug-lispm@oz

Goldy got an error in the scheduler in SYS:TRANSPORT-INTERNAL saying
"Internal error in the GC... Non enclosing structure" and asked me to
report it.  The GC count was 16 according to GC-STATUS.  It was pretty
broken, so I couldn't look around much at it.

I have been noticing a general lossage on Goldy that seems to be
somewhat repeatable (although each repitition takes many days) that
may be related to the GC.  To summarize about four occasions in the
last several months, what seems to happen is that array leaders end up
with garbage in them.  This generally breaks either the namespace
server or the file server (as that's all Goldy does).  Sometimes it
will also report disk errors while serving, although this may also be
caused by the trashed array leaders.  Goldy does not have much memory
(1024K) so it has to do a lot of paging while it's doing the GCing and
serving.  It also pages off of two different disks.

Subject: The L command in Zmail (Rel4)
To: BUG-LISPM at MIT-MC

In Zmail in Symbolics 3600 Release 4.5 on Merlin:

I am very bothered that the L command reads a set of labels to replace
the message labels with, rather than a set to add to the message labels.
If I have a message with 5 labels, I have to type six names in order to
add a label. Also, if I misspell a label, a spurious label gets created
which I cannot get rid of. Also, I cannot abbreviate a label because
there is no completion available. This is amazingly tedious.

Especially since Babyl has the behavior I'm asking for, it's frustrating
because I frequently forget and lose several labels on a message when I
think I'm just adding one. Sometimes I don't notice that I've done this
and the effect can be very confusing.

Also, I'd like a -L command to remove a certain set of labels (leaving
the rest alone). This behavior is also like Babyl.

Please no arguments about how I should be using a mouse to change only
one label.  I'm a touch typist and 3600 mice are all-too-frequently
accompanied by a tracking surface that has been worn smooth, rendering
the mouse unable to move reliably because it can't get any traction.

	Date: Tuesday, 6 November 1984, 14:11-EST
	From: Kent M Pitman <kmp at MIT-MC>

	In Zmail in Symbolics 3600 Release 4.5 ... on Merlin:

	... I tried the Map Over menu to see if there was a way to remove
	keywords via map, but there is not. ...

    Maybe I don't understand what you are asking, but what's wrong with 
    [R: Map Over / Unkeywords], I mean besides the grammer?

Actually, I thought I'd looked carefully at the menu and didn't see it.
So while I agree this means it could have been done, it wasn't "obvious".
I don't find the name "Unkeywords" very readable. "Keywords" isn't a verb,
but I don't mind it being on a menu since I think "Hack keywords." But
I don't like "Unkeywords" since I don't think "Hack unkeywords". 

I'll bet it's the fact that the "Add" one is just called "Keywords" 
that caused me to not see anything else. It sounds too generic. Also, I'd
have expected the two to appear vertically next to each other, not 
horizontally next to each other. Many menus are column oriented and I'm
more adjusted to scanning down columns than cross-ways. I'm not as likely
to notice the relation between items which are horizontally adjacent as
I am items that are vertically adjacent. I realize that 
makes the menu harder to lay out since the geometry is probably just
"fill" style, but if doing something to get past that makes the menu
more readable, I encourage it.

As far as the items themselves, they could either be collapsed from 
"Keywords" into "Add/Remove Keywords" (flushing "Unkeywords") so that
Left-Click could do the Add and Middle-Click could do the Remove, or
there could be two menu items but they could be called something more
suggestive -- eg, "Add Keywords" and "Remove Keywords".

    From: Kent M Pitman <kmp at MIT-MC>

    In Zmail in Symbolics 3600 Release 4.5 on Merlin:

    I am very bothered that the L command reads a set of labels to replace
    the message labels with, rather than a set to add to the message labels.
    If I have a message with 5 labels, I have to type six names in order to
    add a label. Also, if I misspell a label, a spurious label gets created
    which I cannot get rid of. Also, I cannot abbreviate a label because
    there is no completion available. This is amazingly tedious.

    Especially since Babyl has the behavior I'm asking for, it's frustrating
    because I frequently forget and lose several labels on a message when I
    think I'm just adding one. Sometimes I don't notice that I've done this
    and the effect can be very confusing.

    Also, I'd like a -L command to remove a certain set of labels (leaving
    the rest alone). This behavior is also like Babyl.

    Please no arguments about how I should be using a mouse to change only
    one label.  I'm a touch typist and 3600 mice are all-too-frequently
    accompanied by a tracking surface that has been worn smooth, rendering
    the mouse unable to move reliably because it can't get any traction.

OK, but the mouse interface, that is, the menu provided for
[Keywords(R)], is really the answer to all your points.  However, in
Release 5 and later (I have no way to try this out in Rel 4) the L
command is pretty useful too (if you intuit the right behavior), in that
c-m-Y will yank into the minibuffer the current list of keywords.  You
can then add new labels and edit the old ones.

Unfortunately, you have to guess that c-m-Y will do that.  I suppose the
prompt message should be improved.

The right solution for your specifications, and in general for the
extraordinarily schizoid conglomeration of mouse and keyboard interface
that Zmail has, is to provide a Command Processor interface in Zmail.
This is a post-release-6 goal.

    In Zmail in Symbolics 3600 Release 4.5 on Merlin:

    The documentation for the "S" command (COM-ZMAIL-SAVE) in ZMail
    says something about "Right gives menu of ...". Since "S" is not
    a mouse command, this documentation is spurious.

Zmail is rife with this sort of thing.  You'll find that <help>x, for
most values of x, produces a similar message, in which mouse selection
options are intermixed with the operations for plain and
argument-bearing keyboard input.  For instance, see <help>R.  

These help texts need a thorough revamping.

The file attribute list could be augmented with a Bugs-To field.
This could be saved on the pathname so it would be accessible from the 
source-file-name property of each function.  C-M in the debugger could look
for this and initialize the TO field to go to that person.  This would
probably reduce the number of bug reports incorectly sent to BUG-LISPM,
and could increase the number of bug-reports which get to the people who
should see them.

There are some obvious scoping problems, which are probably unsolvable.
Bugs are often caught by error checking in working code, so the user
might have to go down the stack to find a function that seems responsible
for the problem.  Alternatively the bug report could be sent the maintainers
of all functions active on the stack.  This seems wrong, but it might
not be as bad as it seems, since in most cases this would only be BUG-LISPM
and one application program.

	Experimental RELATUS 131.119, FEP 22, on Lisp Machine Jim Morrison:

	These used to work in 5.1.  Why were they broken in 5.2?  It sure seems pretty
	bogus to gratuitously break functionality like this in a released system.
	Does this mean that MIT has to pay N thousands to $ to get it back by buying
	TCP?
    ...
    I would hope that MIT will buy TCP so that it can talk TCP directly.  We
    certainly had a lot of interest on the recently concluded beta-test.  I
    don't believe that the price is excessive considering what you get.

I'm not sure I'm allowed to say this, but since it should be on the
price list I'm going to say it anyway.  Just in case, I'll leave out
some numbers.  The pricing strategy is IP/TCP for $nK per machine up to
X machines, at which point the site gets a site license and the cost per
additional machine above X is for administrative registration ($100 I
think).  Guessing on the number of machines MIT has, and assuming 80%
will want TCP, the cost per machine is about $450 (per machine at MIT).
Therefore, your N is .45.  Additionally, you will get a LOT LOT more out
of this TCP/IP than you did with the old gateway code.  For example, you
can have a LISPM be a server on the Internet instead of just a user.

P.S.:  Trying to keep the old code working would be imitating IBM: keep
things working forever.  It is somewhat unfortunate (I was upset) that
TCP gateway service fell into this category.  Note also this only
affects MIT, since MIT is the only site to have such a CHAOS->TCP
gateway service.

    Goldy got an error in the scheduler in SYS:TRANSPORT-INTERNAL saying
    "Internal error in the GC... Non enclosing structure" and asked me to
    report it.  The GC count was 16 according to GC-STATUS.  It was pretty
    broken, so I couldn't look around much at it.

c-M would have been helpful, had you been able to save the result.  I
assume you are running the latest 5.2 on Goldy.  I'd be curious to know
if you have an IO6 or an IO2 on Goldy.  The microcode name it uses is
good enough to tell me.

    I have been noticing a general lossage on Goldy that seems to be
    somewhat repeatable (although each repitition takes many days) that
    may be related to the GC.  To summarize about four occasions in the
    last several months, what seems to happen is that array leaders end up
    with garbage in them.  This generally breaks either the namespace
    server or the file server (as that's all Goldy does).  Sometimes it
    will also report disk errors while serving, although this may also be
    caused by the trashed array leaders.  Goldy does not have much memory
    (1024K) so it has to do a lot of paging while it's doing the GCing and
    serving.  It also pages off of two different disks.

There have been random reports from SCH about this same class of error.
Without poking around (SCH isn't very accessible) I can never determine
much of what went on.

    Would it be possible to separate MIT specific business from the rest
    of the gripes useful to the community of SLU in general ?
    You easterner could create a MIT-BUG-LISPM to report MIT specific problems.

    Any takers ?

    That would cut in half (+/- 25%) the number of messages in my mail box.

[Unless some mailing list accidentally forwards to Bug-LispM@oz, or
vice-versa, I can only assume you really meant to send this to
Bug-LispM@oz.]

Bug-LispM@OZ  >>>>>IS<<<<< the MIT specific Bug-LispM mailing list.
It also happens to be accessible to the outside world, which is not the
case of most Bug-LispM@site mailing lists.  It's all or nothing; either
get the bugs MIT reports, complete with MIT specific problems, or don't
get them.  Maybe you should look into your area Users's Group.

	From: Kent M Pitman <kmp at MIT-MC>

	In Zmail in Symbolics 3600 Release 4.5 on Merlin:

	I am very bothered that the L command reads a set of labels to replace
	the message labels with, rather than a set to add to the message labels.
	If I have a message with 5 labels, I have to type six names in order to
	add a label. Also, if I misspell a label, a spurious label gets created
	which I cannot get rid of. Also, I cannot abbreviate a label because
	there is no completion available. This is amazingly tedious.

	Especially since Babyl has the behavior I'm asking for, it's frustrating
	because I frequently forget and lose several labels on a message when I
	think I'm just adding one. Sometimes I don't notice that I've done this
	and the effect can be very confusing.

	Also, I'd like a -L command to remove a certain set of labels (leaving
	the rest alone). This behavior is also like Babyl.

	Please no arguments about how I should be using a mouse to change only
	one label.  I'm a touch typist and 3600 mice are all-too-frequently
	accompanied by a tracking surface that has been worn smooth, rendering
	the mouse unable to move reliably because it can't get any traction.

    OK, but the mouse interface, that is, the menu provided for
    [Keywords(R)], is really the answer to all your points.  
All except his point about not being able to use the mouse.  I can also
make a point that I don't WANT to use the mouse because I am a touch
typist.
    However, in
    Release 5 and later (I have no way to try this out in Rel 4) the L
    command is pretty useful too (if you intuit the right behavior), in that
    c-m-Y will yank into the minibuffer the current list of keywords.  You
    can then add new labels and edit the old ones.

    Unfortunately, you have to guess that c-m-Y will do that.  I suppose the
    prompt message should be improved.

    The right solution for your specifications, and in general for the
    extraordinarily schizoid conglomeration of mouse and keyboard interface
    that Zmail has, is to provide a Command Processor interface in Zmail.
    This is a post-release-6 goal.

There are some other things that can be done.  [First a Multics aside.
On Multics, this would be done as 3 commands:
	+L to add a keyword
	 L to set the keywords
	-L to remove a keyword.]
I would suggest putting in a flag, defaulting ON, such that typing L
automatically does a c-m-Y.  (I know this isn't what BABYL does.)  This
would make it obvious that the keywords are being edited.  I think this
should be investigated for 6.0 or 6.1.

To add completion, it would have to figure out which keyword you are
editing when you hit <Complete>, or something.  For the future,
probably.

As for lack of error checking for misspelled keywords, I sometimes like
being able to add a new keyword without an excess of interface.  Maybe
this should only be allowed with a numeric argument to L?  I think this
should be investigated for 6.0 or 6.1.

There should also be a keyword editor so you can delete keywords (after
verifying none of the loaded files use them).  For the future,
probably.  There should also be an automatic version which marks all
unused keywords for deletion.

It's got an IO2.  c-M worked well enough for me to get the buffer for
mail, but any key I typed at that point would put me back into the
scheduler error, so I couldn't save it for you.  Maybe next time it
will  be c-Mable.  As far as the frames go, I think it was just
process-scheduler and then the transport-internal error.

Sending mail takes an inordinate amount of time due to namespace connecting.
To send a simple piece of mail to OZ, I had to connect to Godzilla, Riverside,
Stony-Brook, and Goldilocks (three or four times to Goldilocks).  After a
while, I gave up, inhibited validity checking, set ZWEI:*MAIL-NETWORK-HOST* to
(NET:PARSE-HOST 'MC) and resent the mail.  It went off right away.  No random
connections to everywhere.   

Am I REALLY going to lose by doing this?  It sure saves a lot of grief.

    Sending mail takes an inordinate amount of time due to namespace connecting.
    To send a simple piece of mail to OZ, I had to connect to Godzilla, Riverside,
    Stony-Brook, and Goldilocks (three or four times to Goldilocks).  After a
    while, I gave up, inhibited validity checking, set ZWEI:*MAIL-NETWORK-HOST* to
    (NET:PARSE-HOST 'MC) and resent the mail.  It went off right away.  No random
    connections to everywhere.   

    Am I REALLY going to lose by doing this?  It sure saves a lot of grief.

No, you won't lose unless MC is down.  This behavior (connecting all
over the place) should be a lot better in the next release.

Your bug is that you are running microcode 313 in Release 5.  I'm
surprised your machine didn't crash before this.  I don't know how you
got that microcode (I have a guess), and I suggest you ask whoever gave
it to you to make an FPA microcode that will work for Release 5.

    Clicked on edit screen, move multiple.  I was over an editor with
    multiple windows.  When I moved the mouse, little mouse turds were left
    all over the place.

The microcode does more error checking than it used to.  If it didn't,
floating point numbers wouldn't have been caught.  The corresponding
Lisp code in Release 6 sets up the NIL values you see in locals 9
through 38 with fixnums so the microcode doesn't trip.

    As for lack of error checking for misspelled keywords, I sometimes like
    being able to add a new keyword without an excess of interface.  Maybe
    this should only be allowed with a numeric argument to L?  I think this
    should be investigated for 6.0 or 6.1.
It should query "Really add the new keyword ospys (Y or N)? ". I have been
screwed by this too many times to count.  Is that an acceptable compromise?
    There should also be a keyword editor so you can delete keywords (after
    verifying none of the loaded files use them).  For the future,
    probably.  There should also be an automatic version which marks all
    unused keywords for deletion.
Yes.  Currently, you cannot get a keyword out of the KEYWORDS menu
except by cold boot or the Zmail equivalent thereof, if that.

You're using an unreleased microcode in a world which is incompatible
with it.  Scott Cyphers "borrowed" that microcode to check out the FPA.
I don't guess anyone minds if you use it, but don't complain when it
doesn't work.  [It does fix an FPA bug in (FLOAT fixnum), though.]

You have to cold boot zmail and edit your BABYL file before zmail reads
it back in.  Once a keyword is defined, it is associated with the BABYL
file.  They are not automatically GCed, nor should they be.

In Release 4.5, Reasoning Utility Package 29.0, FEP 18,

The way the system code is written to handle compiler warnings is
generally pretty winning in that it has allowed me to make use
of the whole warning facilities (incl. Edit Compiler Warnings, etc.)
for my own idiosyncratic type of "compilation".  In doing so I discovered
(so far) one minor bug in the system code.  I suggest you redefine
SI:DEBUGGING-INFO as below.  The only change is in the ****** line
in which it checks it it actually has a function spec before it tries
to take the definition.  This is because when this function is called
from SYS:FUNCTION-PARENT, it is already given a function definition, which
in my case is an idiosyncratic list.

    No, you won't lose unless MC is down.  

This is why I have a defcom that sets ZWEI:*MAIL-NETWORK-HOST*.

    This behavior (connecting all over the place) should be a lot better in the next release.

OK, I'll experiment with the namespace method then.  But if it's ANY slower at
all, why should I bother?  By "the next release" I presume you mean Rel 6 and
not another rel 5 version.

    In Release 4.5, Reasoning Utility Package 29.0, FEP 18,
    site configuration 62, on PA Lisp Machine Merlin:

    The way the system code is written to handle compiler warnings is
    generally pretty winning in that it has allowed me to make use
    of the whole warning facilities (incl. Edit Compiler Warnings, etc.)
    for my own idiosyncratic type of "compilation".  In doing so I discovered
    (so far) one minor bug in the system code.  I suggest you redefine
    SI:DEBUGGING-INFO as below.  The only change is in the ****** line
    in which it checks it it actually has a function spec before it tries
    to take the definition.  This is because when this function is called
    from SYS:FUNCTION-PARENT, it is already given a function definition, which
    in my case is an idiosyncratic list.

I needed to do something like this for Prolog, too.  It's not clear what
the policy about the contents of function cells should be, but it does
seem like we need to define such a policy and make sure that all of our
tools can deal with whatever we allow.

(You should see what m-X List Callers does when you put a circular list
in a function cell.)  [That's how I implement REPEAT.]

    (DEFUN DEBUGGING-INFO (FUNCTION)
      (DO () ((NOT (SYMBOLP FUNCTION)))
	(OR (FBOUNDP FUNCTION) (RETURN))	;NIL if undefined

I can't reproduce this.  Since it works for you in a bare world,
something in your environment must be screwing you.  To figure it out,
I'd need (at a minimum) the FEP "Show Status" information, including all
the PCs, and the microcode version you're running.  Probably also the
backtrace info from the FEP debugger.  (If you don't know how to
run the FEP debugger, don't bother yet.)

	As for lack of error checking for misspelled keywords, I sometimes like
	being able to add a new keyword without an excess of interface.  Maybe
	this should only be allowed with a numeric argument to L?  I think this
	should be investigated for 6.0 or 6.1.
    It should query "Really add the new keyword ospys (Y or N)? ". I have been
    screwed by this too many times to count.  Is that an acceptable compromise?
Do like Select Buffer.  Offer completion over the current set of keywords,
complete on comma, beep if it's not in the completion set (but accept it, 
provisionally, for comma).  When Return is typed, beep if there are any not
in the currently known set, say which, and say that c-Return will take them
as they are.
	There should also be a keyword editor so you can delete keywords (after
	verifying none of the loaded files use them).  For the future,
	probably.  There should also be an automatic version which marks all
	unused keywords for deletion.
    Yes.  Currently, you cannot get a keyword out of the KEYWORDS menu
    except by cold boot or the Zmail equivalent thereof, if that.

If you don't have a program called FEP:>Vxx-debug.flod, where xx is your
FEP version number, you should.  See the 5.2 Patch Notes, page 43,
section 10.8.2.  From that you should be able to tell us what function

anything obviously wrong in it?

Subject: conformally displaced arrays
Cc: allegra!mit-eddie!bug-lispm@oz.ARPA, hjb@mit-eddie, kwc@mit-eddie

There are problems with conformally displaced arrays.  These may already
be known, but I couldn't find anything in the documentation specifying
limitations on their use, so I suppose these are bugs.  Here is a simple
demonstration (done with base = 10.) of the more basic problems.

First, array-length gives a misleading answer.

     (setq a (make-array '(10 5)))
 =>  #<ART-Q-10-5 75052027>
     
     (setq b (make-array '(7 4) :displaced-to a :displaced-conformally t))
 =>  #<ART-Q-7-4 75052170>
     
     (array-length b)
 =>  40
     
It apparently multiplies the first dimension of a by the second
dimension of b, so the area whose length is actually returned is not b,
but b plus the portions at the end of each column of a which are not
part of b.

Because of the funny value array-length returns, many other system
functions do the wrong thing.  To show what happens, I'll first fill
array a such that the two indices for each element are the two digits of
that element's value.

     (loop for i below 10 do (loop for j below 5 do (aset (+ (* 10 i) j) a i j)))
 =>  NIL

     (listarray a)
 =>  (0 1 2 3 4 10 11 12 13 14 20 21 22 23 24 30 31 32 33 34 40 41 42 43 44 50 51 52 53 54 60 61 62 63 64 70 71 72 73 74 80 81 82 83 84 90 91 92 93 94) 

Listarray is one function that has trouble with the conformally
displaced array because of the bogus value from array-length.  It conses
up a list as big as array-length instructs, and then fills in only part
of it.  

     (listarray b)
 =>  (0 1 2 3 10 11 12 13 20 21 22 23 30 31 32 33 40 41 42 43 50 51 52 53 60 61 62 63 NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL)

Things get real interesting when we make another, non-displaced, array
with the same dimensions as b, and copy b into it.

     (setq c (make-array '(7 4)))
 =>  #<ART-Q-7-4 75052400>

     (copy-array-contents b c)
 =>  NIL

     (listarray c)
 =>  (0 70 41 12 10 80 51 22 20 90 61 32 30 1 71 42 40 11 81 52 50 21 91 62 60 31 2 72)

This is definitely not the same as (listarray b), which one might
reasonably expect it to be after doing a copy-array-contents between two
arrays with the same dimensions.  What's happening becomes clear if we
unscramble array c by printing its elements in column-major order (the
actual storage order) rather than row-major, as listarray does.

     (loop for j below 4 nconc (loop for i below 7 collect (aref c i j)))
 =>  (0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 1 11 21 31 41 51 61 71 81 91 2 12 22 32 42 52 62 72)

The copy started at the first element of array b (or of array a if you
wish), and proceeded to copy the next (array-length c) elements of array
a into array c, including the parts of array a that aren't even supposed
to be in array b.  Instead of getting the first 7 elements in each of
the first 4 columns of a, we got the first 28 elements of a - all of the
first 2 columns and the first 8 elements of the third.  This assumedly
happens because %1d-aref, as used in copy-array-contents, doesn't know
about conformally displaced arrays.  In fact, it looks like aref is the
only function (besides make-array) that knows about conformally
displaced arrays.

When supdup'ing from a 3600 to a unix-running vax (i.e. prep),after the first screen of data, the first character on each line
starts to disapear as soon as the newline character
is received.

i.e., while the first character if each line is printed,
it is erased when the cursor moves down to the next line.

This happens on both prep and mit-vx.The problem goes away for one screen full if you do a clear.

Try it, you'll see what I mean.

Subject: Gratuitous whitespace in VMS style Dired listing
To: bug-lispm at MIT-OZ

Release 5.2 on Lisp Machine Sid Vicious (3670)

Is there any reason why the VMS style Dired listing takes more space and
displays less information than the ITS style Dired listing?  This is
particularly aggravating when using a narrower than normal (78 char wide)
Zmacs window.  Can you either remove the extra white space, or make
Dired smart about making best use of the available space (something like
the c-X c-B lister)?

I can't reproduce this.  Since it works for you in a bare world,
something in your environment must be screwing you.  To figure it out,
I'd need (at a minimum) the FEP "Show Status" information, including all
the PCs, and the microcode version you're running.  Probably also the
backtrace info from the FEP debugger.  (If you don't know how to
run the FEP debugger, don't bother yet.)

there is no relatus on robot-4, so tell it to skip loading patches.  tell it
"yes" and "proceed" in all the obvious places, going with the default in all
cases, telling it yes to create the package 'ta with default characteristics.
compile the files in the editor in the following order:
	jmhmods

ignoring the other files and ignoring any complaints (they don't matter)

Thanks for the Show Status information; I presume that will enable someone to
determine what your problem is and get it fixed.  I thought I ought to mention
that, at least in older FEP versions, the Show Status command bashes the state

I believe this shows a bug in handling the :but-first clause in defstruct

    (defstruct (justification (:type :list)

When we expand this accessor

    (demons thing)

we get this

    (NTH 3 (THING THING))

which should be

    (NTH 3 (JUSTIFICATION THING))

The problem is in the definition of the accessor subst (the following came
from the eval-when generated by the defstruct form above:

    (SYS:DEFSUBST-WITH-PARENT DEMONS
                              (JUSTIFICATION DEFSTRUCT)
                              (JUSTIFICATION)
      (NTH 3 (JUSTIFICATION JUSTIFICATION)))

It seems like si:expand-subst-definition is substituting for every occurence
of the argument JUSTIFICATION.  Shouldn't the argument be a gensym or
something that doesn't interfere with the but-first function?

Thanks for the report.  In the next major release, this will be fixed, because
the substitution is done more intelligently (it only substitutes for symbols that

around this is to name the defstruct something different.

I was wondering why my LOAD-AND-SAVE-PATCHES was occasionally going off
and grovelling at MC (which is down), so I C-M-Break'ed it, and, well,
have a look at what it's doing.  It's trying to get MC to identify the
host KANSAS for it.  Looks like someone has been kind of brain-damaged
about modifying the site files, or something.

because of the following.  Here is the function GET-SOURCE-FILE-FULL-NAME, which 
is called by DESCRIBE-SYSTEM.

     ;;; Get the source file name, rather than the generic pathname.
     (DEFUN GET-SOURCE-FILE-FULL-NAME (FUNCTION-SPEC &OPTIONAL TYPE &AUX PATHNAME SOURCE-PATHNAME)
       (SETQ PATHNAME (GET-SOURCE-FILE-NAME FUNCTION-SPEC TYPE))
       (COND (PATHNAME
	      (SETQ SOURCE-PATHNAME (SEND PATHNAME ':GET ':QFASL-SOURCE-FILE-UNIQUE-ID))
	      (IF SOURCE-PATHNAME
		  (FS:MAKE-PATHNAME ':HOST (SEND PATHNAME ':HOST)
				    ':DEVICE (SEND PATHNAME ':DEVICE)
				    ':DIRECTORY (SEND PATHNAME ':DIRECTORY)
				    ':NAME (SEND PATHNAME ':NAME)
				    ':CANONICAL-TYPE (SEND SOURCE-PATHNAME ':CANONICAL-TYPE)
				    ':VERSION (SEND SOURCE-PATHNAME ':VERSION))
		PATHNAME))))

Its local var PATHNAME will in this case be (GET-SOURCE-FILE-NAME 'headers 'defsystem),
which returns
     #<LOGICAL-PATHNAME "KWC: DISTRIBUTION; KWC; PUBLIC-SYSTEMS">
The local SOURCE-PATHNAME is then set to this pathname's :QFASL-SOURCE-FILE-UNIQUE-ID
property, which is
     #<UNIX-PATHNAME "SW: //lispm//kwc//rel5//experimental//distribution//public-syste.l">
Then FS:MAKE-PATHNAME is called on a mixture of the components of these two pathnames.
The host - #<LOGICAL-HOST KWC> - comes from the logical pathname, and the version - :UNSPECIFIC -
from the unix-pathname.  And FS:MAKE-PATHNAME of a logical host and an :UNSPECIFIC pathname
gives the above error.

Is this an oversight in GET-SOURCE-FILE-FULL-NAME, or is it the case that a logical-pathname
should never have a unix-pathname for its :QFASL-SOURCE-FILE-UNIQUE-ID?  If the latter, how
could it have ended up with one this time?  In case it might help, here's more information on
the logical pathname:
