For the Nth time, INFO-LISPM is (surprise!) NOT where to send
questions about LispMs, their software, hardware, manuals, or
whatever.  The right place to send such commentary is BUG-LISPM, which
includes the LispM maintainers and such LispM users as care to see all
the bug reports and discussions of how to fix them.  INFO-LISPM is a
very much larger list, comprising everyone who wants to see
system-change announcements.  Many people on INFO-LISPM don't use
LispMs or even don't have access to any, so messages like yours are
only junk to them, as well as loading down COMSAT unduly and eating up
unnecessary disk space.
