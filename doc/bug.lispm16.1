    When I do m-X Source Compare, the default filename is poor (a

On the contrary, it has always been this way.

I think most people agree with you that it should be changed.
I don't much care myself, since the default is never right for

I even changed my habits in response to the welcome change.
Somewhere it got changed back.  Since noone owns up to changing it
back, I presume it was accidental, a patch not making it into the

The most obvious explanation would be that your disk pack has a bad spot
on it.  Try doing a (disk-restore 4 t) and then immediately (disk-save
5) and see if that works.  By the way, you're running way behind the
current patch level (222.57).

If you read in oz:ps:<hdt>lispm-init.lisp.62   ;;not lispm.init
And do meta-x Evaluate buffer you can have the fun experience
of being stuck in a process wait of Run with the clock stopped.
Warm booting will work, and trying this three times caused it to
crash in the same place.  [You'd need to have some variables bound first
like user:zwsave-p and do a (defun load-notify-silent (f &optional p) (load f p))]

Compiling this file works, with no warnings or errors, but try 
LOADing it (the .lisp).  It dies just like in ZWEI.

LOADing it in a seperate process manages to have read crap out
with some gibberish and the warning that (I forgot which) base
is 8. but ibase is 10.  Now as normally load craps out at exactly
52%, its well past having set the bases.  The qfasl manages to
zap you at 51%.

I fixed the silly bug in my file, but am not impressed with the different
ways the different means of getting the forms into my world blow up.

Subject: c-Return in c-X c-B (Select Buffer)
To: BUG-LISPM at MIT-OZ

In System 222.131 ... on Lisp Machine Twenty-two:

When I type an existing buffer name to Select Buffer in ZWEI and follow it
with c-Return, the following bad things happen:

 * It does not complain that the buffer already exists. It seems to me that
   c-Return indicates my belief that no such buffer exists, and it should try
   to correct this misbelief with some sort of warning or query.

 * The previously existing buffer is not selected, but rather...

 * A second buffer with the same name as the already existing buffer is created.
   This is bad because I may think that the system or I myself have clobbered the
   previously existing buffer and assume the text is lost. If I am bright enough
   to do c-X c-B (List Buffers), I will find that I have two buffers which have
   the same name and are hence very hard to tell apart.

Subject: The effects of m-X Set Package
To: BUG-LISPM at MIT-OZ

In System 222.131 on MIT Lisp Machine 22...

At the very least, should m-X Set Package cause (possibly conditional on a switch)
resectionization of the buffer? Invariably, the info m-. uses is not correct after
doing this operation until a full buffer sectionization has occurred.

Sometimes this is the wrong behavior. Sometimes one would like to change the
buffer's package without changing the functions in it. In such a case, one almost
wishes there were some smart program that could take
 (defun foo (x) x)
 (defun bar (x) (+ x *y*))
and change it to 
 (defun old:foo (x) x)
 (defun old:bar (x) (+ x old:*y*))
when the package was changed from some old package to a newer one. I'm not really
asking that this be put in, because it's very hard to do both correctly and
aesthetically, so it's probably not worth the bother, but I point it out as an
alternate reasonable of what "should" happen after a m-X Set Package.

In any case, I think the current behavior (assigning PACKAGE, modifying the
attribute list) is better than what went before it but still falls just a little
bit short of doing the right thing.

To: BUG-LISPM at MIT-OZ

In System 222.131 on MIT Lisp Machine 22...

In line with my previous note about m-X Set Package, m-X Set Base might want to
be able to tell you if it mattered what the base was. It probably wouldn't be too
hard to have it replace base n numbers with base m numbers in a sort of query 
replace type of way in the buffer so that you didn't break code already in the
buffer by wanting to change the buffer's default package. Naturally, it would 
ignore expressions bounded by a #nR or #O, and numbers ended by a decimal point.
It might also want to (perhaps querying first) ignore comments and/or things in
string quotes.

    Is there any reason in the world why I should have to wade through notes like
    this in BUG-LISPM?
Yes!!  Because when a random user stats using a LispMachine, he has not
been taught that bug-hardware is the probably right place to send
hardware problems.  Therefore, for each new user (typically) you will
see one message to bug-lispm when it should have been to bug-hardware,
and then they will do the right thing in the future (because 20 people
sent them nasty notes saying they goofed).  We need some way to tell
complete randoms about bug-hardware.  Also, did CC actually generate the
message?  If so, perhaps CC should be fixed to use bug-hardware as the
initial recipient.

Subject: Cleaning up source directories
To: BUG-LISPM at OZ

A further thought on this.  One reason people are reluctant to delete
old versions of files is that they might be needed to go with old system
versions (especially if large incompatible changes like NES have been
made in the meantime).

A possible solution would be version-structured system directories.
This would work as follows: Initially, all the files would be in a
directory for some version (say 86).  When development for a new version
started (say 91) a new directory would be created and any results of new
editing would be put there.  M-. in Zwei would have to understand the
structure of directories.  I.E., if the file you were looking for didn't
exist in the 91 hierarchy, it would check the various directories going
backwards until it found the desired file.  However, it would never
recover sources for newer versions unless you specifically asked it to.
When you save the results of editing, they would be stored in the
hierarchy of the version you are running, or the hierarchy of the file,
whichever is newer.

I could see two ways of implementing this on the file server: 1.  Have
separate top-level directories (i.e. <L.91.ZWEI>), or 2.  have the
various directories have subdirectories for each version (i.e.,
<L.ZWEI.91>).

On any given directory, one could safely take a given file down to two
versions (or even one for obsolete versions which are not being actively
hacked).  Thus it would be easy to determine what to delete, and what
not to delete.

The official Symbolics Release 4.0 band for the LM-2 (and CADR) is now
available, and should supplant the earlier versions distributed.  It has
been newly compressed, and takes less room than patched earlier
versions.  (19900 pages).  Also, it goes with microcode 979, which has
some bug fixes.

It consists of System 222.140, Zmail 74.28, LMFS 30.15, Hardcopy 11.12,
and Tape 13.0.  This configuration is displayed in the herald as simply
"Release 4.0".  Any systems which are patched beyond this level will
still be listed separately in the herald.  The comment on the disk
label is "Rel 4.0".

The final 4.0 version of the 3600 software is not yet available.

There is a copy on LM16, configured for MIT.

Enjoy.

When I do help L in this mail buffer, it tells me my input was not being

Why is the default zwei fill column so big?

I got this doing (apropos 'compile).  Does that mean I have old ucode?  
What is the current ucode?  How do I "QC-FILE-LOAD" anyway?

No tag for this pc: you have a bad version of the error table.  This
will be fixed when you get the new L-Machine system.  For now, part of
the booting procedure should include (dbg:load-error-table ...).  I
can't remember the args since I don't have access to a LispM right

    It seems inconsistent that when prompted for a file with "(Completion)" 
    and a default (eg, by c-X c-F), that typing Altmode will fill in the 
    default, but when prompted for a system name with "(Completion)" and
    a default (eg, by m-X Add Patch), typing Altmode just beeps and will
    not fill in the default.
You are right, it is inconsistent.  I believe that completing a blank
string against a default should always give you the default.  Unfortunately
the modularity of default handling is completely wrong now (it is done
by each caller of COMPLETING-READ-FROM-MINI-BUFFER in an ad hoc fashion).
That will have to be fixed first, and then this will fall out naturally.
All this stuff is going to be fixed in the next system after Release 4.0,
as I understand the current plans.

    mousing kill for a window should ask for confirmation like killing a

    Also, it would be more aesthetic not to have the highlighting extend

To: BUG-LISPM at OZ

In System 222.131 ... on Lisp Machine Twenty-two:

If QUERY-IO is bound to some other lisp listener, then if I am logged in but
my file server has died and I try to do a file access, I am prompted for my
password on the second lisp listener, but I cannot answer the prompt. The 
normal case, if one's password is not the name of a lisp variable, is to 
see the password echo and then be told it's not bound as a variable. This is
not very satisfying.

I am almost always bothered by where the password prompt ends up coming up. It
has a very bad interaction with most things that I am doing. I would *much*
rather see it be a pop-up window so that it can KNOW it is doing I/O on a stream
it can read from, control the echo on, etc. and so that any cruft it types out
doesn't mess up what's in the window of the process that ends up needing the 
password.

I can even imagine a little window with mouse options for things like changing
your userid or logging in anonymously so that this complex hair to do with typing
Altmode to enter a username can be done away with.

Subject: Supdup windows on color screen
To: BUG-LISPM at MIT-OZ

In Release 4.0, site configuration 9, on Lisp Machine Apiary-2:

I created a full-screen SUPDUP window to OZ on the color screen
and the Lisp Machine seems to misinform OZ about the width of the screen.
When typing out a file with long lines which cause wraparound, the 
excl appears on the first column of the next line. This also causes
OZ to misjudge the length of the screen.

    If you change the SI:PARSE-HOST to check for non-Chaos hosts, Terminal-F
    wont bomb out on me when I have put hosts like "AI" or "SCORE" in my

    typing those host names to Terminal-0-F.  I'd really like it if you put

Subject: Tag vs Tags
To: BUG-LISPM at MIT-MC

In System 222.131 ... on MIT-LISPM-22:

I find it confusing that sometimes the word "Tag" is used and sometimes "Tags".
Eg, there is Tags Search which searches a Tag Table. But Find Tag (which may,
incidentally, find more than one tag). Is there a coherent theory as to when
one name is used and when the other. I note I have buffers named 
*Tag-Table-1* and *Tags-Search*. When I try to select one, I'd rather they both
complete to *Tag- or *Tags- and then I could type "T" or "S" for Table or Search.
As it is now, they complete to *Tag and then I type either "s" or "-" which is
not notably mnemonic. I'm sure the same problem comes up with people who do
Apropos looking for "Tags" and miss all the functions which have only substring
"Tag" but no "s". I recommend that Tags Search become just Tag Search, etc.

Your problem has nothingto do with windows.
You have two processes reading from the same stream.
This is an undefined situation, like reading from
a file input stream from two different processes.

What do you expect this to do?  How is the system to
decide which process deserves the characters?  How
is the system to decide that this stream is the value
of query-io in some environement?

It has nothing to do with QUERY-IO; it's just that you're trying to do input
from two different processes on the same stream, which doesn't work.
Putting an explicit error check for all such cases of this would theoretically
be a good thing, but I don't see any reasonably easy way to do it.

Sorry if you get this 6 times because of all the mailing lists, but this
problem exists in many places, and should really be resolved on a global
scale.
		     ------------------------------
What we need to do is document what ITS expects to see for line width,
and what it expects the terminal to do when you try and type something
on the last line (stick versus wrap).  We should then make sure each
user implementation and the non-ITS servers strictly obey this.  (If you
read the SUPDUP RFC [a copy in MC:DCP2;RFC SUPDUP], you will find the
following, which I think is sufficient for everybody to check their
programs.

[Page 2]
The SUPDUP protocol originated as the internal protocol used between parts
of ITS, and between ITS and "intelligent" terminals.  Over the network,  a
user host acts like an intelligent terminal programmed for ITS.

[later in Page 2]
Because this is also the internals of ITS, the right to change it any time
if necessary to provide new features  is reserved by MIT.

[Page 3]
Note:  the terminal must not do an automatic CRLF when a character is
printed in the rightmost column.  If this is unavoidable, the user
SUPDUP must decrement the width it sends by one.

    If I am working in lisp listener and have the variable L2 bound to a second
    lisp listener, then
     (LET ((QUERY-IO L2))
       (TYI QUERY-IO))
    will not be able to read from L2 because the lisp listener associated with L2
    seems to get first shot at all the characters that are bound to L2.

    If there are certain kinds of windows which are simply not capable of being 
    used as good values of QUERY-IO, could someone please
     * Characterize them.
     * Put that characterization in some prominent place in the documentation.
     * If it's mechanically detectable, give me an error when I try to do this
       TYI of the form "Attempt to TYI on Lisp Listener 2 from two processes."
       (only the second process need err) or explain why such an error would not
       be a good thing.

The rule is very simple:  it never works to have two processes reading from
or writing to the same stream at the same time.  (For window streams, but
not other kinds, some effort has been made to insure that if two processes
WRITE to the stream at the same time, you will see the output from both of
them, perhaps interleaved, rather than seeing only one, or having the
stream's internal data structure get completely broken, or whatever.)

If you want it in terms of QUERY-IO, it never works to bind QUERY-IO to
a stream that someone else is (or may be) reading from.

If you want a window to pop up when you are asked a question, bind QUERY-IO
to such a window, or bind it to a syn stream to TERMINAL-IO and bind
TERMINAL-IO to TV:BACKGROUND-STREAM (or is that
DEFAULT-BACKGROUND-STREAM?); this will create and expose a window the first
time it is needed.  I think it currently only works for this to be the
value of TERMINAL-IO, because when the background stream replaces itself
with a window, it SETQs TERMINAL-IO to the new stream (the window).

Actually neither of these words should be used; we should come up with
a new name for "set of files used as a universe for searching."  But
the Zwei word-by-word completion means that you can just type "Tag" and
it will stick on the "s" itself if it wants it.  This works for me; is
there any context where it doesn't work for you, or did you just not
think of it.

Subject: not exactly about Supdup windows on color screen
In-reply-to: The message of 16 Jan 1983 12:35-EST from David C. Plummer <DCP at SCRC-TENEX>

What ITS expects is for typing a character in the last column of a line to
leave the cursor in that column, and for line feeding off the last line
of the screen to scroll by the number of lines specified in the terminal
characteristics (ITS won't use this unless the user says to use scroll
mode).

Thus the -only- way to move the cursor from one line to the next is via
line feed (or %TDCRL or cursor-positioning).  The terminal is required
not to have any "intelligent" features where it secretly moves the cursor.
I assume the Lisp machine Supdup is blowing it.

The TCMXH variable specifies the line width in number of characters.  This

In System 222.131, Hardcopy 11.11, Zmail 74.26, LMFS 30.14, Tape 13.0,
microcode 977, site configuration 6, Vanilla, on Lisp Machine Twenty-two:

The following examples were performed with BASE and IBASE set globally to 7.
The exact same problems happen with BASE bound to 10 decimal, but I figured 7 
was a very distinctive value and would clearly identify what was going wrong
in this note...

(1) In a fresh editor buffer in Fundamental Mode,

      m-X Lisp Mode
      m-X Update Attribute List
    
    creates a fresh attribute list which looks like:
    
      ;;; -*- Mode: LISP; Package: USER; Base: 8 -*-
    
    I hope this is a bug. I don't find it even remotely reasonable.
    Oh, and (send zwei:*interval* ':get ':base) => NIL
    which is a further inconsistency.

(2) In a fresh editor buffer in Fundamental Mode (with no text in buffer)

      m-X Lisp Mode
      m-X Reparse Attribute List
      m-X Update Attribute List

    creates a fresh attribute list which looks like:

      ;;; -*- Mode: LISP; Package: USER; Base: 7 -*-

    At the very least, (1) and (2) should be consistent. If it's going to get a base
    attribute, I would prefer it to be the active one rather than one cons'd up out of
    thin air.

(3) In a fresh editor buffer in Fundamental mode (with no text in buffer)

      m-X Lisp Mode
      Type in the text ";;; -*- Mode:LISP; Base:3; -*-" followed by a return.
      m-X Update Attribute List

    has the following effect on the attribute list:

      ;;; -*- Package: USER; Base: 8; Mode: LISP; Base:3; -*-

    The duplicate entries are not very attractive.

    Worse still,

      (send zwei:*interval* ':get ':base) => NIL

    For all those BASE's in the attribute list, you'd think the interval could be
    bothered to acquire the same info on its property list.

Subject: Serious problems with attribute lists
To: BUG-LISPM at MIT-OZ
Cc: HENRY at OZ, ZVONA at OZ, KBE-I-FILE at OZ

Henry and I have both had severe problems with the current attribute list scheme 
that is making it very hard to write code that knows when it is doing the right
thing and when it is not.

Basically, I think that the attribute lists as they are currently maintained work
by too mysterious a method internally. I've cited some of these explicitly in other
bug notes, but I'll summarize here...

 * Properties go for a while with no value, then suddenly acquire one internally.
   This happens with BASE. In Lisp Mode, why does m-X Reparse Attribute List give
   the buffer a :BASE property when there is no BASE in the file's attribute list?

 * Textual attribute information is created when there is no corresponding internal
   property. In Lisp Mode, why does m-X Update Attribute List put Base:8 into the
   property list when the buffer has no :BASE property of 8 and the default global
   input and output radix is 10 decimal?

These are both very bad because it means that code of mine that wants to make updates
to other code living in buffers cannot adequately predict the properties of the buffer.
If it writes something into the buffer in Base 10 and later finds someone has stuck a
Base:8 at the top of the file without updating the buffer info, it loses. If the buffer
claims the base is 8 so it doesn't bother putting "#o" in front of numbers or it doesn't
force the output in base 10 with trailing dots, and then later it finds out that the base
was not labeled as "10" in the attribute list and when the file is re-read it now thinks
it's in base 10, it has lost again. There are a zillion ways to lose. I don't want these
values changing at random. They should change in regular predictable ways.

It would help in my predicitions if there were a way to read/write the attribute list
conveniently. m-X Update Attribute List and m-X Reparse Attribute List are too powerful.
The following primitives are not provided but essential to my work and they are not the
sort of thing I should have to write.

   (ZWEI:ATTRIBUTE-PLIST buffer)
     Should return an s-expression representation of a buffer's attribute list.
     "Mode" should be converted to :MODE, "Font1,Font2,Font3" should be converted to 
     (:FONT1 :FONT2 :FONT3), "3" should be a real fixnum, "Yes" should become T, etc.

   (ZWEI:ATTRIBUTE-PUTPROP buffer value indicator)
     Indicator should be something like :BASE and value something like 8 and it should
     find "Base:anything" in the textual attribute list replacing the "anything" with "8"
     or it should make a new entry for "Base:8".

   (ZWEI:ATTRIBUTE-GET buffer indicator)
     Should return the value of indicator in the property list no matter what.

Another thing which I think would help is if doing m-X Lisp Mode forced an update 
attribute list and if base were something that got forced as an initial part of
both the buffer's plist and the textual attribute list. After all, m-X Lisp Mode
does change something related to the file's attribute list and the fact that this
change is not recorded in the attribute list is one way to lead to later confusion.

Currently, buffers with associated files are maintained better than buffers with no
associated file, which is a loss. Currently also, these functionalities exist but they
come buried amidst lots of unwanted functionality.

I could write these in principle, but ...

 * I would only risk duplicating the effort of everyone else who wanted such, and I 
   think it's more than just me that will want them. You could even use them yourselves
   as building blocks for the other primitives, which are currently quite ugly and hard
   to understand by perusing their definitions.

 * I would be violating several data abstractions which I expect might be highly prone
   to change. What the format of the file property list is; what the relation is between
   the visible keywords ("Mode", etc) and the internal names (:MODE, etc.); etc.

I hope you find this useful feedback and I hope we can work something out here. This is
pretty important stuff to the work our groups is doing and it would be nice if I had
better control. Thanks.

	Is there any reason in the world why I should have to wade through
        notes like this in BUG-LISPM?

    No, you shouldn't. I agree with you. (I had to wade through my own
    message!)  But I thought bug-lispm is the place to send these messages.
    Is there another, preferred mailing list?  If not, let's make one.

if your problem is of a software nature, there are some specialized lists
to deal with certain areas -- BUG-ZWEI for instance; you should be able to
get a list of at least the most common ones by saying (bug) and then asking
for a menu of possibilities, or in zmail by mousing BUG. i haven't used a
LispM in a while but i think mouse-right in both cases is the right thing
to get you a menu of bug lists. if none of them seems to be especially
appropriate, then send to bug-lispm; if you picked the wrong address
someone is sure to correct you.

i don't well remember your original msg but perhaps the problem was lack of
information -- saying the machine died is no help to fixing it unless you
can give more information about what you had been doing before, and other
pieces of state. if your error throws you into the error handler, there is
a way to send bug mail including several useful pieces of state; ?  to the
EH prompt (or something like that) should include said method in its list
of possible commands. if your machine has completely died, there is a
program called CC, which you run on another LispM after connecting the two
with a debugging cable (AP1 and AP2 probably are already connected so as to
be able to debug each other). the commands are slightly arcane but there
are several people around who have used CC -- get help, don't just give up.

for hardware problems, well, first produce some evidence that it's a
hardware problem, like disk crashed or machine refuses to boot.  if your
lispm was built by symbolics, complain to service@scrc (you shold cc: to
hewitt in the case of the apiaries or rivest in the case of his 3600, so
they know what's going on).  for all mit-built machines there is the
equivalent BUG-HARDWARE.  again, in either case, explain what was going on
before the disaster, and what the bad behavior looks like.  remember, mail
of the form "lispm ## died." is content-free, and can only frustrate people
who might be able to fix your problem..

Actually, the way to get the menu of possibilities is to mouse right on
Mail in Zmail, which will include Bug as a kind of mail to send.  Clicking
right will get you a menu of places you can send bug mail.

He sent the message from CC with CC's :MAIL command.  I'm the twit
that made it send to BUG-LISPM for some reason.  Fixed in 222.142.

    for hardware problems, well, first produce some evidence that it's a

    equivalent BUG-HARDWARE.  
This is good advice.  There's a mailing list BUG-APIARY-MACHINES that
should be used in the case of Carl's machines.  :MAIL in CC can only
make a guess, and if you can supply a narrower list to send to, please
do so by editing the header :MAIL supplies for you.

    of the form "lispm ## died." is content-free, and can only frustrate people

Actually, if I recall the message correctly, the main reason it was
content-free is that the :WHY and :MAIL commands don't do the right
thing with parity errors during a disk xfer.  It did contain most
of the relevant info, but that was edited out of the reply.

I fixed the specific problem in 222.141, but getting the info clears the
error, so :MAIL after :WHY still will lose.  To be fixed someday.

        (CADR-4) to OZ.  I can, however, connect to MC -- and MC and connect to OZ!
        Is there a problem with OZ today?  Or with the Chaosnet?

    At about 4:30 this afternoon a large chunk of the chaosnet went of the net.
    The reason you could get from MC to OZ is because OZ and MC are both on
    subnet 1. How you got to MC, I'm not sure. 
WRONG!!!  Part of subnet 6 is down.  The problem appears to be at
the OZ/AI-CHAOS-11 side of the cable.  If you look (probably
ancient history by the time people see this) at the status
information of oz-network-11, you will see extremely large
numbers of lost packets and CRC errors on subnet 6.  From MC, you
can hostat ne43-7a, ne43-9a and xx, but you cannot hostat toto's
subnet 6 address.  Well, ai-chaos-11 responds from subnet 6, so
my guess is oz-network-11's subnet 6 interface is broken.
Somebody should really take a look at the physical condition of
the various cables.

One of these days people will stop making assumptions and
actually poke around.  I've poked as much as I can from 10 blocks
away.

Another one of these days I'm going to write
(chaos:analyze-network) that will let you make assumptions about
what's wrong and what isn't, and probably be at least 70% correct.

p.s.:  If the original message turned out to be valid, it should
have gone to BUG-HARDWARE.

If you try to make a Window Error Handler one of the two elements of a
split screen, it comes up, but the frame constraints are such that you
don't see ANY of the elements of the stack (the pane just above the

thing.

I could stand to lose a line or two of typein area to get at least one
line of stack.

Subject: Visual definitional delineations, sections, and such...

In System 222.140, ...

I would prefer that if there is a function followed by a page break
followed by another function, that the whitespace (at least) and
probably the comments below (this never happens to me) would belong
to the section.

I don't like the fact that commands which act on the "current definition"
seem to use sectionization information (or something equally mysterious)
rather than doing the equivalent of c-E c-m-A. (The c-E is so if we're on
the first line of a definition, the c-m-A doesn't take us to the previous
definition. The reason is that sometimes this applies to a definition which
I don't find intuitive. eg, suppose my buffer looks like:

    (DEFUN FOO (X) (BAR X))

    ;;; (BAR x)
    ;;;  
    ;;;  Just another name for (BAZ x).

    (DEFUN BAR (X) (BAZ X))

and my cursor is on the line after (DEFUN FOO ...). I would like c-sh-C
to always compile FOO always. As it is, it is frequently willing to compile
BAR instead because it thinks that the whitespace and comments below FOO
belong to BAR. This is even more confusing when there is an intervening
Page character because then it's really obvious where the separation is.

In general, I think that commands that are done directly from the definition
should use some criterion which does something that feels natural (using
natural separators like the Page character where available) and which is
easily determined visually.

I have taken to always typing c-m-A c-sh-C when I'm not on the definition
line to be sure I get the obviously correct form, but I find this somewhat
tedious because it loses my place in the buffer and sometimes even requires
redisplay if the head of the definition is off the top of the screen.

This problem hit me yesterday in the form of an Add Patch. It added the "wrong"
form to a patch file and I wasn't paying careful enough attention to all the
verbiage typed out by Add Patch, so didn't notice it in time to keep it from
getting compiled by a Finish Patch. Had to manually correct the patch files
later.

Several of the problems you point out are either bugs that have been
fixed, or a real problem with the default value of the BASE attribute
that is indeed a conceptual-level bug that I should analyze and fix, but
not a major problem with the attribute scheme.

       (ZWEI:ATTRIBUTE-PLIST buffer)
       (ZWEI:ATTRIBUTE-PUTPROP buffer value indicator)
       (ZWEI:ATTRIBUTE-GET buffer indicator)
OK, try loading oz:<dlw>attr.lisp and see how you like it.  Please let
me know what happens with this.

    Another thing which I think would help is if doing m-X Lisp Mode forced an update 
    attribute list...
I asked people about this at one point and got mixed replies.  It's on my

How much trouble would it cause if the twiddle command didn't move
the cursor after it was invoked, i.e., it allowed you to un-twiddle
what who just did by just going (^,m-,c-m-,ect)T.  

It is sometimes difficult to determine what is really being twiddled,
and making it easy to restore the buffer to its original pre-twiddle
state seems to be a much more worth while goal than being able to twiddle
several things in succession.

Well, the Multics people have a completely different concept.  Instead
of twiddling the 'items' on either side of the cursor, they twiddle the
two items before the cursor.  (I don't like it, but...)  It makes some
sense for c-T, but starts to fail as you go to m-T, c-m-T and c-X c-T.

Anyway, giving c-T a negative argument will undo the previous c-T.  I
have actually used successive twiddles and now expect their behaviour.
My most common use is giving c-m-T an argument somewhere around -3.
I'm sure it isn't hard to change in your local environment, but I would
vote to keep the history.

Subject: Flavorized whostates?
To: BUG-LISPM at OZ
Cc: KBE-I at OZ, JWALKER at SCRC, HENRY at OZ

It has come up several times in my work that I would like to
have processes that interact among each other be able to know
something about the state of the other process. Sending a
:WHOSTATE message to the other process is about the best one can
do and it's far from good enough. The reason is that you have
to be a linguist, a master at deciphering abbreviations, and
pretty good at knowing what all kinds of things processes can
block on. For different applications, the kinds of things you
will want to block on are different. Eg, net I/O is something 
that is likely to clear on its own. "Tyi" is typically not going
to de-block itself without human (or smart program) intervention.
"Sleep" will probably clear on its own. "Bored" (that's one of my
own) is something that might or might not need or want to get 
cleared. Why would I care? Sometimes I send a message to an actorlike
process (putting it in its mailbox) and it's busy and I would like
to know the probability that it will get looked at. eg, if the
process is erring and so in a "Selected" or "Tyi" state, I probably
want to warn the person submitting stuff that the other process
isn't likely to respond to it unless he does something to de-block
the process. The point of all this is that a whostate is a sort of
condition and flavorizing it would help a lot. The only thing the
manual defines about them is that "RUN" means it's going and anything
else means it's blocked. Wouldn't it be nice if you could tell if
the block was a stop or a pause? Wouldn't it be nice if you could tell
if the the block was something caused by the network, i/o, a lock of
some sort such as the compiler or the window system, etc. ? Well,
I think it would be worth thinking about at least. A process's state
is much more complex than just a string. One might even want to think
there could be more kinds of "RUN" whostate than just run. Imagine,
(defflavor integrate-whostate () (si:run-whostate)
 (:default-init-plist
    :string "Integrate"
    :description "Performing symbolic integration."))

(with-whostate 'INTEGRATE-WHOSTATE
	       ...)

so that you could see "Integrate" to mean "RUN" in the wholine but still
have your process continue running and people could tell what was going
on by sending your process a mesage getting its whostate and asking questions
about it. Probably you'd only do this for rather large regions of code since
the overhead of instantiating the flavor might be high, but still, integration
is usually not a small operation. Good caching schemes and better with-...
primitives could likely be worked out as well.  Maybe the whostate could
even be mouse-sensitive so that when you touched it with the mouse, the mouse
documentation would tell you more about what the state meant.  Getting it worked
out so that it didn't cost much would take a bit of thinking, but it'd have
some nice payoffs if it could be made to work.

Think also of the poor user who's never seen "Tyi" before and wonders what
kind of state that is. The self-documentation feature would help him a lot.
And what new user hasn't wondered what "Net Finish" or "Data Conn Listen"
means... Anyway, you get the idea...

Here's a sample piece of code that I have which tries to do this sort of 
thing so you can see the sort of special case ways I have been dealing 
with this problem up to now...

;;; :PROCESS-STATE
;;;
;;;  Returns two values describing this actor's internal state:
;;;
;;;   (1) A string describing this actor's state.
;;;
;;;   (2) A flag saying whether this string is likely to be interesting
;;;       to the user if he hasn't specifically requested it. This 
;;;       flag is NIL if the actor is `happy' (active or bored) and T
;;;       otherwise (meaning the actor is blocked in some state that may
;;;       require manual intervention to clear).

 ;; This is actually subject to a timing screw since the stack group might
 ;; change between the time we poll for a whostate and the time we check
 ;; the stack group, but I don't know the right primitives to get around
 ;; this problem and since the information is never used by a program,
 ;; (ie, is only intended to be heuristically interesting to human users)
 ;; I'm going to not worry about that for now. --KMP

The code you sent returns a rest argument. Since the rest argument is

is placing a rest argument into permanent data structure. You probably
want to use copylist to copy the rest argument.

    This bug report would be more useful if you would have taken the trouble

If the error occurred while inside the rubout handler, you may not
have entered the debugger at all.  You may have gotten a one line
error message and then something like "Type <Rubout> to edit ...".

If this is the case, you should (SETQ DBG:TRACE-CONDITIONS T) and
try to reproduce the problem.  This will cause you to enter the
debugger when the error occurs again, and then you can use c-M.
You can't leave DBG:TRACE-CONDITIONS set to T for a long time while
using the machine, since it causes the debugger to be entered when any
condition is signalled.

    I would like a way to compress my environment in core without having to save
    a band. The MIT system seems to be able to do this. You can do an in-core
    GC and then dump to a small band without having to dump to a band and then
    do a compression. Are there technical problems involved in getting this to
    happen on Symbolics systems or is it just a matter of devoting manpower to
    doing it? When can we reasonably expect this sort of thing to be available?
The copying GC makes the maximum address in use larger, while leaving
holes in the middle of the address space.  Since the disk-save format
is simply a one-for-one copy of the address space, up to the maximum
address stored, it uses up disk space storing the holes.  The compressor
relocates everything to get rid of all the holes.  The way this GC works
would make it rather difficult to do the relocation and fill up all the
holes without using a separate compressor (it can fill in holes that
are big enough, but smaller holes remain, because it cannot go through
any intermediate states where two regions overlap.)

On the 3600, and in the "MIT" system, the disk-save format is different
and contains only those pages that are actually in use; the holes do
not take up any space.  I doubt that we can spare the manpower from
more important tasks to make this incompatible change to the disk-save
format on the LM-2 in time to make any difference.

Our usual technique for compressing is to use a machine that has a
T-300 disk, and to temporarily edit the label to merge two LOD partitions
into one double-size one.  This means that you smash a total of 3
partitions during the compression process, out of 6 or 7 on the T-300.

This is an incompatibility in TV sync (nano)programs, perhaps
coupled with something strange about the TV board in your machine
(perhaps it is very old and doesn't have the sync program in prom).

To further complicate matters, a long time ago someone at Symbolics
discovered numerous mistakes in the MIT sync program, at least when
used with VMI monitors.  Probably the sync program used at Symbolics
contains these corrections and the one used at MIT does not, leading
to incompatibility.

Is it that there is a large amount of black area at the top and bottom
of the screen?  If so, you can open up the monitor and adjust the
vertical size pot to expand the picture to full size, unless you
have one of those monitors that refuses to work with too large
a picture.  Be sure to get someone who knows how to avoid getting
killed by high voltage to do this!

Or is that there is a large amount of white area that just stays
blank, or stays with some unerased garbage on it, outside the
part of the screen that is actually displayed on?  If so, you
are getting from somewhere a sync program that displays a different
sized screen than the size our software expects.

When you cold-boot the machine, does the screen glitch, or does it
remain solidly on?  The former indicates that you have no hardware
sync program and the software is reloading it from its idea of what
the sync program ought to be; the latter indicates that the hardware
is taking care of the sync from a prom.

SET-TV-SPEED (or whatever it is called) is still around, I believe,
and you might be able to get some results that would be more
useful to you by calling it.  It ensures that the window system
and the TV hardware agree about the size of the screen by reloading
the sync program.

You are doing the right thing.  Your diagnosis that killing a process
didn't run its unwind-protects is correct (in the case where it had multiple

This happens with the LispM's at EECS, too (it is noticeable on the ones
that have both MIT and Symbolics bands).  When I boot a Symbolics band,
the bottom of the screen contains what was there when the MIT band was
running (the wholine, mouse documentation line, and a couple more
regular lines) below the Symbolics wholine.  The screen tops seem to
match, though.  I once tried SET-TV-SPEED in order to correct this (back
when we were running 210, or maybe even the release before that), but it
caused the screen to waver so I set it back.

packet from a connection ....  
   I can expect that, but every time I got back to my zmail, I'd 
get the following.  Yeah, I can fix it on my machine, but this shouldn't happen
in the first place.   Chaos connections dying is pretty common, as there probably is
a good chance of a your host crashing while you are using zmail.  Zmail could try to
be a little more clever when it notices your associated machine has gone down.
[It could even offer to write your files out to another machine, after 
obtaining from the user some kind of pathname translation mechanism.]

[Also, the algorithm for which host to send the mail to in the non-zmail mode
could try remembering the host that succeeded last and try to use if first.
Its fun seeing connect oz connect mc connect xx connect ... every time I
send a piece of mail now.]

Why can't notifications hack more processing and be more clever
about using an existing window.  Yes, I know this is an old system,
but I have a couple of tv:notify's occur in rapid succession.

The first types out ok, but hits a more break and just proceeds along,
and I can't see the beginning.  Within the second, I get a couple more
notifications and seperate windows are created.  I'd be willing to be beeped
and have my notification window get a more break followed by new text.

In Release 4.0, site configuration 6, on Lisp Machine Two:

I can't tell if this is a hardbug or software bug.  

Rel 4.0 will not run on this Lisp Machine.  After the most nominal
amount of consing it thinks it has used up all its virtual memory.  I
can reproduce this bug just by logging in and doing (load
"src:<circuit>defsystem").  (It chokes while trying to create an
array for the symbol table of a newly declared
package.)  I have tried rel 4.0's and mcr's from various cadr's doing
compare-bands all the way with no success.  I have varied the bands I
put the rel 4.0 and mcr on.  Nothing helps.  System 91 (as least 91's
loaded before this machine recent spat of problems) will boot and run
OK.  Doing (gc-status) to the out-of-memory-trap says there is lots of
room left.

Allow me to take this opportunity to flame at the jerk who
originally moved rel 4.0 to this machine without testing it
(and destroyed the only vanilla 91 on this machine in the process):
Go away, we don't need you.

Subject: c-%, m-%, and m-X Undo
To: BUG-LISPM at OZ

In ZWEI in Symbolics Release 4.0,...

* c-% (Replace String) does not set up for m-X Undo at all. This is bad.

* m-X Undo after a m-% (Query Replace) prompts "Undo Replace?" when it should
  (1) mention the word "Query" and (2) mention that it's only the last
  replacement it'll effect.

The combination of these two just completely screwed an important buffer of code.
I had done a part of a m-%. Then I intended to pick up with another m-% but 
did a c-% by accident. In an attempt to undo the damage, I did m-X Undo and it 
prompted "Undo Replace?". I answered yes, because I wanted the Replace undone. 
Not only did it not undo the Replace but it did have some effect on the 
Query Replace which I didn't expect it to have had.

Isn't it though?

*CATCH really -does- take 63 arguments; this is because of the kludgey
implementation of catches on the A-machine and the fact that microcode
functions can't take &REST arguments.  You don't usually stop the program
while it's executing in the middle of *CATCH, so you don't usually see
this.  (LIST-IN-AREA T T) produces an even more amusing frame printout,
for the same reason.

I guess we need to put in a kludge for this.  Fixed on the L-machine,
of course.

Subject: File server: simultaneous acces, meta-x Bug: Bug.

Aborting out of saving a file on OZ caused me to get an
Invalid Simultaneous access (at 5542) inside FILE SERVER.

[Minor point:
  Doing meta-x Bug <space> <help> claims that there are no
possible completions of what I have typed, while typing return will
still do something useful.]

While from what I remember of the completing reader (in zwei) it
probably wouldn't be worth it to do this without a special crock, but ...
  it wouldn't be too unreasonable for meta-x Bug Lispm, 
meta-x Bug Magic-site-list, and friends to actually work.

In Symbolics Release 4.0, site configuration 9, on Lisp Machine Apiary-2:

;Compiled
(DEFUN LOSE (M &OPTIONAL (N 0))
    (COND ((= N M)
           (BREAK "Major Lossage"))
          (T (ERROR-RESTART (ERROR "Try ~:R order lossage." N) (LOSE M (1+ N))))))

I was curious what kinds of fun things would get offered if I did LOSE of a very 
big number.

This was how the FORMAT bug was detected, by the way, so I guess some real good came
of it. 

It's also worth noting, though, that it said (after many screenfuls of listing) that
c-m-s-h-# or Abort would get us back to toplevel of the Lisp Listener, but that's
not actually true ... Typing c-m-s-h-# just beeps. So whatever is typing out what
commands will work to resume is not communicating very well with whatever is reading
those commands. I don't imagine too many people will notice if this doesn't get fixed.

Oh, the column that the actions prints out in is just a touch narrow. 
c-m-s-h-<Hand-Right> and things like that take up more space than is allocated,
though all in all, the way they come out looks ok.

Also, the fact that s-<301>, etc. are offered as options to get back was pretty 
amusing. Can these be typed? I bet there are a bunch that can't be and even more
that can't be on an L-machine.

Have a nice day.

Subject: (new//old subject): 2 mail sending crocks

Ok, I'll buy the logic behind two mail sending modes for a while.

In the control-x m flavor of mail, How about doing the same thing as 
zmail does when I hit end while I'm typing in the headers (ie. move the
cursor to the beginning of the text of the message, or just after the
--Text follows this line--  ;;I don't think I really want to know what 2
			    ;;of these lines in my text will do.

It should be pretty easy to do, and I don't think many people really 
want to send a blank message too often.  It also really wouldn't cause
any lossage, as typing end twice would still win.

I have noticed that supdup causes meta to capitalize any

this breaks my editor, can it be made an option in supdup

I note that even after I have turned off ovestrike on the lispm,
I still connects to remote machines saying that it is an

is it possible to have a flag in the supdup window label saying

Not easily, since there is no such thing as meta-lowercase-aye
in the Lisp machine character set.  Conceivably m-shift-A will
happen to send a code that you find useful.

Aren't there better uses for Lisp machines than as Supdup terminals?

This probably is not a gc bug, but its something.

I did a (gc-immediately) and one of the next few things I did was attempt to
send mail.  My machine went into Run, and needed to be coldbooted.

Chaosnet was working fine, and I discovered that calling (zwei:parse-addresses "hdt@oz")

    I'd also like to know if there's some good reason that
    FS:PARSE-DIRECTORY-DATE-PROPERTY still calls the general time parser,
    since supposedly we have fixed all the file servers to only return dates
    and times according to the specified format.

OK, nobody knows any reason, so I have changed things so that if a date
is returned that does not conform to protocol, the following error message
will appear:

The FILE server violated protocol: "whatever" is not in the right date-time format.
Please report this bug.  To try using the full time parser, set FS:*USE-FULL-PARSER* to T
and try again.

In theory, all file servers have been fixed so that this won't happen;
but I left in this variable just in case, so that if some server is
still broken it will be possible to get around the problem.  This won't
appear in Rel 4, of course.

I just had a thought about how to fix the time-zone bug in the file
protocol, which you might want to implement or suggest for
implementation.  That is, have LOGIN return an extra value on yet
another line, which would be the time zone the machine reports its times
in. This should probably be in minutes from GMT so half-hour and
nameless time zones would continue to work.

This could also be implemented as another type of command, although
since everybody has to log in to every machine, it might as well be done
as part of login.

In Release 4.0 in the file system, when making backup tapes, the lisp
machine tends to go into an endless Net in condition just before
starting the first file of a tape.  control-meta-break and then
telling it to start the backup of that file will then get it going
sometimes, provided it starts out by doing a net out.  This is when
the backup is being done to Speech.  Once it gets going, everything is
fine until the next tape when it happens again.  Does the Net In just
take a long time to happen, or should there be a timeout-try again in
the wait?

Also, it would be very nice if upon completing a tape the lisp machine
beeped once.

            Oz just killed my file job right in the middle of fasdumping a
            large data structure.  Is this really necessary?  Why can't Oz
            be smarter about what file jobs it kills?

        This message should have been sent to Bug-File@OZ along with a
        backtrace of the transactions. Unfortunately without any debugging
        info, we can't help you.

    What can I do to keep Oz from killing my file job?  This seems
    like a simple question that doesn't need a backtrace.

OZ does not kill file jobs.  It is possible that the job died for any
number of reasons. File jobs go away after a period of time if not used.
If you are really serious, get me or some other hacker the next time
the error occurs, and we'll try to figure out what is going on.

You might also find a LispM Systems hacker, who might shed some light.

Indeed the question is simply stated, but the information content is
roughly:  "My file job died. Why?".  It is has not been established
that OZ killed it.  Without the proper debugging information, it is
near impossible to debug a vague perhaps spurrious error.

I hope this message is taken in the spirit of helping that it is
intended.  A file transaction is rather complex, and let's say
somebody at OZ accidentally killed the wrong job, or somebody
disconnected your chaos transceiver momentarily, or, or...

Subject: can't fasload dumped flavorized hash-tables
To: BUG-LISPM at MIT-OZ

In Release 4.0, site configuration 10, on Lisp Machine Apiary-2:

Well, I can make hash tables real well with the new flavorized
implementation, and I can fasdump them too.  Problem is I can't seem to
fasload the qbin files back in.  I made the dump of src:<gavan>a-dictio
by saying:

(compiler:dump-forms-to-file "oz:src:<gavan>a-dictio" (send a-dictio ':fasd-form))

this is the correct way to do such a thing, right?  Here's what happens
when I attempt to fasload the qbin file.

Subject: CDR'ing down mail hosts should be smarter
To: BUG-LISPM at MIT-OZ

In System 222.123, Hardcopy 11.11, Zmail 74.26, cold load 48,
microcode TMC5-MIC 173, site configuration 5, on River Concord:

When trying to mail a message, when cdr'ing down the list of mail hosts
(zwei:*mail-chaos-hosts* or whatever). When a host is down, in addition
to trying the next host, that host (the one that is down) should get
moved to the end of the list so that it won't get tried first next time.
Or maybe it should only get moved one farther down the list or
something.

This is to prevent a host that is down for a long period of time from
making you wait for the LISPM to figure out that it is down each time
you want to send a message.

In-reply-to: The message of 27 Jan 83 23:28-EST from Martin David Connor <MARTY at MIT-MC>

It is more subtle than you think.  Note that some LispM users use
Network-L to log out.  This sends the SUPDUP logout sequence (and
probably does nothing in TELNET).  This works on ITS, which correctly
understands the SUPDUP sequence.  TWENEX can't do much about it (now),
so the best it can do is detach.  Therefore,

(1) TWENEX should be fixed (good luck, since this brings up some of the
    same issues that terminal location brings up), and
(2) People who use Network-L on TWENEX should try and change their
    habbits.

    From: D. Scott Cyphers <SR.CYPHER at MIT-SPEECH>
    In Release 4.0 in the file system, when making backup tapes, the lisp
    machine tends to go into an endless Net in condition just before
    starting the first file of a tape.
Are you sure it's endless, or is it just a long time?  Have you looked at the
tape drive when this is happening?

There is a known problem that would explain your symptom.  The backup
dumper, before writing on a tape, tries to read it, in order to warn you
if it is about to overwrite another tape.  Since you are using a brand
new tape, trying to read the tape gets an error, and the RTAPE server,
seeing the error, retries the operation five times, not knowing that the
error was fully expected.  Also, each read takes a long time because the
tape is blank and so the tape controller runs a long time before
deciding that something is wrong.  So, try leaving it in the "Net In"
for many minutes and see whether eventually it starts dumping.  If so, we'll
know that the above is the problem; if not, we'd like to look into it further.
Thanks.

That's what was happening - it reads the entire tape before deciding
it is blank.  Since it is fairly obvious when you remove the tape from
the sealed plastic that there is nothing of value on it, and for other
similar situations, how about an option that means just assume the
tape is blank with a question asking if you're sure.  I tend to get
nervous when things go into a wait state for minutes at a time, since
it usually means trouble when they do.  Also, is there a preferred way
for changing the defaults on the host to backup to, etc?  This would
make it easier when we get someone to do our backups for us.

When the compiler gets a wrong no of args to macro (or any macro-expansion error) 
it seems lke it would be better if instead of generating an error at compile time
it generated a warning at compile time and compiled in a form that would generate
an error at runtime saying something like this this macro expansion failed at
compile time because of wrong no of arguments... Or some such thing. The reason I
am re-suggesting this is that it still screws me sometimes when I start something
compiling and walk away only, and then come back to find out that it didn't really
get very far into compilation etc...

Subject: Multics file server and links
To: bug-chaos@multics

The Multics chaos file server doesn't write through links.  If I write
out a file onto Multics, and the pathname it writes to is a link, the
link gets replaced by a segment, and the target of the original link is
still there.  This is due to the fact that the file server doesn't want
to modify the file until it has all been read in, so it creates a new
file and moves the names and properties of the file when it is done.
This mechanism has other problems.  One is that it requires the writer
to have "sma" access to the directory, but the user would expect to only
need "w" access to the segment.  Any suggestions??

In Remote-File 22.0, LMFILE-Remote 23.1, MIT-Specific 16.0, System 91.35,
ZMail 48.6, microcode 204, on Arthur Dent:

Suggestion: PROCESS-LOCK should take an optional WAIT-TIME argument,
such that if it took longer than that many seconds to get the lock a
resumable error is signaled.  WITH-LOCK should take a :WAIT-TIME option
that specifies this, also.  These constructs are useful if a lock is
held by a process that is stuck or hung.  You might even want to make it
default to something like a minute so that existing programs will get
the benefit without having to be modified.

Speaking of locks - is there anything in Lisp Machine locking like
Multics' "Lock was held by a dead process, so it was reset".  On Multics
the hardcore system primitive can tell whether the lock was held by an
existing process, and if not, it locks the lock and returns a code
indicating this (so that the new lock-holder can attempt to clean up
things if necessary).

    Any suggestions??

Implement versions on Multics and have access control understand them
(especially with write through links to a file you have write access but
a directory you don't have modify access)??  The only practical
suggestion I have is to make yet another change in the FILE protocol for
a user->server message saying "write over existing file and I am willing
to lose if it bombs out."  If anybody takes this seriously, be sure to
create a (login-forms ...) form that allows one to set which hosts this
should apply to.  Also document the message sent to the host unit to
turn this on and off.

Easier then this is to have the FILE server stash the file in a
temporary file (like in the process dir) until the transfer is known to
be completed sucessfully. Then it can overwrite the originally existing
file, chasing through links as is necessary.

All this means is that the stack wasn't big enough to hold both the
compilation and all of the function calls need to expose the typeout
window to print a compiler warning.  This happens sometimes.  All you
need to do is to hit Resume to make it continue with a larger stack.

Your message doesn't exactly make sense ("end up in the rubout handler"?)
as typed, but if we parse it as "sometimes I'd like to get into the debugger
for errors signalled by something that is reading input", you can use the
variable TRACE-CONDITIONS to control what conditions go into the debugger
before doing their normal action.  Set it to T or see the Release 4 release
notes.

  From cadr-4 (in 91.35), I can't get supdup to get me to ai.
    [Ml and ai are up, mc is down.]
supdup ai simply tries to connect to mc, then tells me that host mit-mc is not responding;
it does not even try to connect to ml.

Supdup mlai says host mit-ml not responding, but supdup'ing to ml and then to ai
will work.

Okay, I understand.  But NOW the question is: why was TRACE-CONDITIONS set to nil in

usually set to nil, what could I have done to change it?  I don't use any fancy

    Okay, I understand.  But NOW the question is: why was TRACE-CONDITIONS set to nil in
    my system?

Read the New Error System documentation when you get a chance.  But, briefly
TRACE-CONDITIONS is NIL by default because it is a debugging feature and ought
not to be turned on by default; it exists to allow you to subvert condition
interception that normally thinks it knows what it is doing.  Errors normally
get to the debugger via a handler, not via TRACE-CONDITIONS.  Errors in the
rubout handler don't get to the debugger because the rubout handler thinks
it knows better and deliberately intercepts them.

I believe there are some people here who have a better theory of when the
rubout handler should trap errors, which they are going to implement some
time in the future.

    When trying to open a supdup connection to a host that is not responding,
    it is impossible to do a control-abort or control-meta-abort.  One has to
    wait till supdup gives up trying to make the connection.

Gregor has produced a version of SUPDUP that fixes this bug.  I audited
it, added some comments, and installed it, so the problem should be
fixed in the next system.  Unfortunately, it's hard to patch, and
although Gregor figured out a way to do it, it's sufficiently hairy that
I'd rather just wait for the next system.

I think this incident is moot now, since we are currently switching
software over to Symbolics, and will no longer need 79 patches.
However, it is likely that we will not switch for a long time to come.
Perhaps there should be a lock file (like there was for binary dumps
in Maclisp) where people could say which old dumps/patch files they
needed.

Thanx for the offer to get them back off of tape.

In Symbolics Release 4.0 on MIT-LISPM-22,...

I found two new LispM users sitting at a console being very confused about where
their text had gone because they had two editor windows, one that had been focused
on one region of the buffer and one on another, and the window they were looking
at was at the end of the file and so the screen was blank. They thought they had
lost all their work when in fact a m-V was all that was called for. Acknowledging 
that it is hard to keep the --nn%-- stuff up to date in the mode line 
efficiently, it would at least  have helped them a lot to see --More Above-- or 
something. They said ethey'd been used to that in Emacs and assumed since it 
hadn't told them there was more above/below that the empty screen was all there 
was. Again I put in my plea for having indicators of some sort. Here are some 
ideas about markers

 Bottom   Top      Middle       Whole
 Bot      Top      Mid          All
 More    More    More       
                             

If Top-Z, Top-X, and Top-D worked as shown on the keyboard, I'd suggest them 
and a "[" (for whole) would make a good set of graphics for these, too. Oh well.

	    In Release 4.0 in the file system, when making backup tapes, the lisp
	    machine tends to go into an endless Net in condition just before
	    starting the first file of a tape.
	Are you sure it's endless, or is it just a long time?  Have you looked at the
	tape drive when this is happening?

	There is a known problem that would explain your symptom.  The backup
	dumper, before writing on a tape, tries to read it, in order to warn you
	if it is about to overwrite another tape.  Since you are using a brand
	new tape, trying to read the tape gets an error, and the RTAPE server,
	seeing the error, retries the operation five times, not knowing that the
	error was fully expected.  Also, each read takes a long time because the
	tape is blank and so the tape controller runs a long time before
	deciding that something is wrong.  So, try leaving it in the "Net In"
	for many minutes and see whether eventually it starts dumping.  If so, we'll
	know that the above is the problem; if not, we'd like to look into it further.
	Thanks.

    That's what was happening - it reads the entire tape before deciding
    it is blank.  Since it is fairly obvious when you remove the tape from
    the sealed plastic that there is nothing of value on it, and for other
    similar situations, how about an option that means just assume the
    tape is blank with a question asking if you're sure.  I tend to get
    nervous when things go into a wait state for minutes at a time, since
    it usually means trouble when they do.  Also, is there a preferred way
    for changing the defaults on the host to backup to, etc?  This would

    Re:   Replying from Pop-up incoming sends window

    In Release 4.0, Experimental Knowledge-Based-Editor 129.0,
    site configuration 9, Black Magic, on Lisp Machine Twenty-two:

    In a pop-up incoming-sends window, I replied to a send and the reply failed
    (other lispm was momentarily busy). The failed message should have gone into
    my Converse window's buffer and been marked as "not sent" but it was just
    discarded and I had to type its text all over again.

This class of problems, as well as any other Converse problems,
are also easily fixed by using set-current-band.  If you don't want to
do that, you're welcome to use the mit source.

Sounds to me like the right thing is to ensure that the screen
is never blank when there is something in the file.  I have
often had the same sinking feeling that you describe.  It is
easy to imagine how something that optimizes redisplay could
think that this is the right thing but it is too scary and
should be special-cased.

That is not the problem.  The tape server was asked to read the tape:
when asked to read, the tape server is contractually bound to try as

that the tape protocol does not include a way to say "read, but you

odd and indeed that the position of the mouse on the screen is itself
restricted to only odd horizontal positions within the window.  Is this
true?

Also, although it appears to say otherwise on page 47 of the 10/14/82
version of the new window package docs, the set-cursorpos and
read-cursorpos methods both deal in coordinates wrt the outside of the
window.  For instance, it is impossible in a window of margin sizes 2 2
2 2 to set the blinker cursorpos to less than (2 2).  Is this also true?

    When trying to mail a message, when cdr'ing down the list of mail hosts
    (zwei:*mail-chaos-hosts* or whatever). When a host is down, in addition
    to trying the next host, that host (the one that is down) should get
    moved to the end of the list so that it won't get tried first next time.
    Or maybe it should only get moved one farther down the list or
    something.

I agree.  Fixed in the source.  To be patched.

Even if it were not backspacing, in order for it to scan to the end of

have seen this happen with streaming tape drives when the io-driver

I like that font information is ignored in search strings. This is obviously
the right thing. Yet I would like to be able to search for, say, the next thing
in italic or the next thing in bold. Perhaps there could be a command
Font Search which prompts for a font-id and finds the next occurrence of that
font. Right now I am editing a paper in multiple fonts and I would like to 
quickly flip through the buffer finding all the keywords which I have highlighted
in bold and copy them to a summary section. Such a command would be ideal for
this application. The default on the command should be sticky. Supposing that
the command was on c-S (odd place to put it), then one c-S should prompt for 
a font ID offering a default and a second c-S (or a return) should accept the
default.

I watched closely during the beginnings of the backup.  It does indeed
go all the way to the end of the tape, moving at a fast rate (although
not at a fast forward rate) with out any jumps.  Seven times during this
process the following message is printed out on the system terminal:

%Problem on device: MTA0, S.N.=2610, Access path:CHN=1, TMO2=0, UNI=0

Other than this long wait on starting blank tapes, everything is fine
with backing up with the system.

My experiments show that :SET-CURSORPOS does accept 0, 0
in a window with margins, and that 2, 2 gives a different result.

There is a feature that the mouse position does not change if the
mouse moves "too little".  This is to prevent a mouse balanced
"on the edge" of a dot from using up lots of cycles.
I would not expect the limitation on moving the mouse by small amounts
to actually interfere with use in practice, but if this is wrong
I can take the feature out.

Good idea; in the source and tested.  Giving the percentage of the way through
the buffer is not such a good idea, because it can't be computed efficiently.
But the "Move above" flag, as in Zmail, is easily computed and (in my opinion)
more what the user would like to see.

Well, I don't know what the system people have to say, but for
me this is a feature, not a bug. (It also fits well in my
model of defsystem.)  I have a system spread over many directories

Subject: An alternative to DEFPROP for setting system options
To: BUG-LISPM @ MIT-OZ

I continue to object to the setup of information via random DEFPROPs.

This amounts to just putting information someplace and hoping it will get
used. Unlike uses of free variables where you get a "declared special"
diagnostic, or functions where you get a "not defined" diagnostic, you
get zero feedback from DEFPROP as to whether you have done the right thing.
Further, you get no feedback when the "right thing" is changed and a
new abstraction is put into effect. Hooking DEFPROP to complain is the
wrong thing since DEFPROP is really a subprimitive and has no right in
caring what properties you set, but I think making a primitive built on
it would be a good idea.

Consider,

(DEFUN DEFOPTION (&QUOTE NAME INDICATOR VALUE)
  (LET ((DATA (GET NAME 'SYS:OPTION)))
    (COND ((EQ DATA 'T) (PUTPROP NAME VALUE INDICATOR))
	  ((FUNCTIONP DATA) (FUNCALL HOOK NAME INDICATOR VALUE))
	  (T (SIGNAL "Attempt to assign ~S, which was not an option."
		     name value indicator)))))

Then you can use DEFOPTION just like DEFPROP except that you'll be able to
do some error checking for the user. Most options would just have a T for
their property, defined of course by 

(DEFOPTION FOO SYS:OPTION T)

but things that become obsolete can put a hook in the SYS:OPTION property
which notifies the user of the change and offers to do an interim correction
perhaps.

For example, on page 92 of 5.3.10, you define a property called EDITING-TYPE.
I'd rather get an error at definition time than have to work for hours trying
to debug why this information isn't being used. The answer, of course, is
that there is no such option type. The option is called ZWEI:EDITING-TYPE (and
it's not LISP-MODE that has it, it's ZWEI:LISP-MODE, actually) ... the
ZWEI: prefixes are missing from that whole example series because 
presumably they were lifted from a buffer which had default package ZWEI.

In Symbolics Release 4.0 notes, LOAD now takes an argument fo 
nonexistent-ok. Supposedly, it errs on anything other than file
not found. This doesn't seem to me to be in the spirit of the
new error system. Why doesn't it take an argument like
'FS:FILE-NOT-FOUND saying what level of error you don't want to
handle. That way, you can specify without a lot of syntax how
important it is that the file be loaded. eg, in init files it
is frequent to not want to load certain files if they are not
there for whatever reason, but certainly having it complain that
a site is down isn't what the user needs. In the case of
truly ignorable loads, the person could give a third arg of 
SYS:ERROR to make sure that any error condition just failed
harmlessly rather than put complex condition-binds in his init.
Special purpose arguments to handle a single condition type
seem like they are overly specific and not worth having around
for the few types when they will do the right thing.

Seems like an excellent idea to me.  I would urge whoever actually implements
this consider that people are sometimes going to want to COMPUTE the value
of some option, so the only way at the facility shouldn't require the use
of a "fexpr" like the one above.  (Also "defoption" sounds to me like the
name of the special form used to DEFINE an option (by giving it a
SYS:OPTION property) rather than the form that is used to adjust its
value.)

Also there should be a documentation string associated with each option.

Actually there is no reason the form should look like a DEFPROP.
Frequently you just want something like: 
(SET-OPTION ZWEI:DEFAULT-MAJOR-MODE ':LISP)
which looks like a SETQ rather than a DEFPROP.  Perhaps the right model is
that the number of arguments to an option is a function of the option only:

(defun set-option (&quote name &eval &rest rest)
  (let ((data (get name 'sys:option)))
    (cond ...
	  ((functionp data) (lexpr-funcall data name rest))
	  ...)))

I agree with all your comments -- especially the concern that it have a non-
fexpr version. I note you are trying to unify the SETQ'd options with the
DEFPROP'd options. I'd like this all to be carefully thought out before anyone
implements anything, since if done right it'd be really useful and if done
wrong it'd be more trouble than it's worth. I'm not sure if unifying variables
and properties is a good idea. The character of how variables and functions 
are treated seems to be quite different and covering them in the same primitive
might not be right. Variables usually allow the user to select amongst a 
usually-finite set of options. Properties usually allow the user to play system
implementor and extend the properties of the system in non-finite, though 
predictable ways.

As a random thought along the lines of variables, I have a facility in the KBE
system which interfaces nicely to all kinds of user interface stuff... Might
be worth contemplating either separately or in light of this recent suggestion...
eg,
    (DEFINE-KBE-OPTION *DEBUG* NIL "Mode of operation"
      :ASSOC (("Debug" . T) ("Normal" . NIL)))
which accomplishes the following:
 * Initializes the option, recording its default value.
 * Allows one (when sending bug notes) to know which options are set 
   to non-standard values (by comparing current value to the default)
   If this had more structure to it, say the name of some subsystem for which
   the option was being defined, eg,
   (DEFINE-OPTION ZWEI:DEFAULT-MAJOR-MODE ':LISP :ZWEI ;subsystem id
     "Default editing mode for newly created buffers."
     :ASSOC (("Lisp" . :LISP) ("Fundamental" . :FUNDAMENTAL)))
   then when sending ZWEI bug reports, you could include information about switch
   variables that had unusual settings. I use this sort of thing in my KBE bug
   report mechanism and it works quite nicely.
 * Allows one to know what valid settings are for the variable and to set up
   structured ways of assigning it (as in choose variable values).
 * Makes for great machine-constructable automatic documentation.

All of this gets you really nowhere when it comes to properties, on the
other hand ... unless you're willing to do lots of MAPATOMS all the time.
This is what makes me think the issue of properties is somehow different...

That's why I proposed the simplest extension to DEFPROP as an initial pass.
It adds exactly only the most obvious functionality and has the nice feature
that once it's in effect, it can at least tell you when it has itself been
superseded by something better. That's the best part -- the thing DEFPROP 
doesn't offer.

Subject: c-X c-O
To: BUG-LISPM at OZ

In Release 4.0,...

This is a bug that has always bothered me and I've never gotten around 
to reporting. With the cursor on the fifth of ten blank lines,
c-X c-O (Delete Blank Lines) will kill all blank lines before and after
the cursor, leaving a single blank line. But with the cursor at the head
of a line preceded by five blank lines, c-X c-O is a no-op, rather than
deleting four of the previous five blank lines.

I also note that when invoked from the a blank line which is both
preceded and followed by a non-blank line, it kills the the single blank
line. This behavior is not documented and seems pretty random to me. I
use c-X c-O in keyboard macros to regularize interline spacing and having
it have this variant behavior in some contexts ends up having undesirable
results. 

The behavior in paragraph one is the same as Emacs and perhaps the second
paragraph behavior also is, but I still don't like it and don't see why
anyone would care if a more predictable behavior were installed.

I wish c-X c-O would behave analagously to ^R Just One Space in the Emacs 
TMACS, which contracts the number of spaces around the point to one if
there is more than one, or increases it to one if there is not. With an
arg, that macro changes the number of spaces around the point to a given
number. Many people put this on Meta-Space in Emacs, I often miss having
it in ZWEI. But in any case, having c-X c-O be defined to make the number
of blank lines near the cursor be exactly 1 (or n with an arg) and to leave 
the cursor on that blank line (or, with an arg, the first or last blank line
or some such determinable place).

Subject: The behavior of Compile Changed Sections is sub-optimal.
To: BUG-LISPM at MIT-OZ

In Remote-File 22.0, LMFILE-Remote 23.1, MIT-Specific 16.0, System 91.37,
ZMail 48.6, DAEDALUS 1.10, microcode 204, no, on Lisp Machine Eight:

I just tags query replaced the name of a structure (ie a defstructed
frob).  I then did M-X Compile Changed Sections.  This would have done
the right thing had it compiled the sections in the order they were
changed (by tags query replace).  Can you make Compile Changed Sections
recompile sections according to the order in which they were changed?
As it stands it went through the buffer list in the reverse order of
the changes (though within each buffer it went forward).

PS zeroing the color map (ie (dotimes (x 16.) (color:write-color-map x 0 0 0)))
should be on the list of things to do at cold boot time.  This would keep
people from frobbing my settings of the dials in order to save the phosphors.
The only problem with doing this is that somebody might accidentally get
the mouse on the color screen and then not be able to get it back.  The solution
to this is to make the color map something reasonable if the mouse ends up
on the color screen when there is a zero'd color map.

    In Symbolics Release 4.0 notes, LOAD now takes an argument fo 
    nonexistent-ok.
This is not a new argument: it has always been there.  It's just that
as a byproduct of the NES it is more precisely defined.  Your suggestions
about being able to control the flavor are basically good (although you
can easily implement them by wrapping a CONDITION-CASE around the LOAD).
I'm not at the right kind of terminal now to find out easily that there
is some reason in the way LOAD is coded that would make it difficult to
implement what you suggest, but there is probably an interaction between
the nonexistent-ok argument and LOAD's search for compiled and source
versions of the file.

I belive that DLA considered all such arguments as this to be for
back-compatibility only.  I agree with this.  Since you can do all this
by putting a CONDITION-CASE around the LOAD, there's no need for LOAD to
redundantly provide another way for you to do the same thing.  If you want
to handle specific errors, just use CONDITION-CASE.

    Take a look at page 16 of working paper 208 (Lisp Machine
    Choice Facilities).

Of course. It's not by accident that my DEFINE-KBE-OPTION stuff is 
compatible in calling conventions with the choose-variable-values stuff.
The point is that this sort of information should properly be part of
the option variable declaration, not part of the info supplied to 
choose-variable-values. This would save a bit of redundant work in
different menus offering the same variables, reduce the possibility of
one set of data getting out of alignment, and provide a central repository
for debugging information about the variable when not in such menus.

Am I missing something or is this not a reasonable idea which would be
worth looking into? Note that it could be done in a way that is upward
compatible with the stuff given at the top of page 17, so that it identified
 (TV:CHOOSE-VARIABLE-VALUES '(BASE IBASE *NOPOINT) 
	':LABEL "Number format parameters")
as identical to the longer examples because it had a 
SYS:OPTION-VARIABLE-DESCRIPTION property. And then illustrate how you can
override such a description (or supply an anonymous description for a 
variable with no global description info) by explicitly saying things like
("Input radix" IBASE :NUMBER).

What is a zero length circular list?? Doesn't it always have to have something
in the CAR? I suppose an infinite list of DTP-FREE pointers would be one
possibility -- so the person can step the list but not CAR into it. But this
seems pretty confusing. I'm curious what other interpretation you've devised.

finger, whois, and some of the time parsing functions now return error objects, as
these functions are called by many other functions, some of which handle the errors 
themselves.  Perhaps if called from top level, the error should be SIGNALLED.

The exponential function EXP traps to the debugger for negative
arguments that are large in magnitude.  This is definitely not the
correct way to handle this input, it should always return floating
point exact zero which is the mathematical result of exp(-x) as x
tends to infinity.  Please fix this immediately or suggest a way
to turn off the debugger so that I can get back to doing science.

This is a worthless error message. When it happens, ZWEI is gronked and it is
next to impossible for a mere mortal to get it to go or to even get any other
window to work. I think someone should definitely find the place where this
error is signalled and do anything within reason to make this a recoverable
problem. eg, force any or all buffers to have their points forced to the head
of the buffer or do whatever manner of drastic action is necessary to restore
consistency, but leaving the user in an error handler debugging ZWEI internals
with his only other apparent option being to cold boot is frustrating and bad.
If you don't buy unconditionally doing this, at least have ZWEI:REDISPLAY have
an proceed or restart handler for this case that allows the user to have something
drastic done to recover a reasonable state of the world. --kmp

to recover from it is:

1. Do a (ZWEI:SAVE-ALL-FILES).
2. Switch to another Zwei window to avoid having Zwei trying to redisplay the
fucked-up window [sometimes non-trivial to accomplish -- you may have to 
do (ZWEI:MAKE-BUFFER-CURRENT ...) (ZWEI:MAKE-WINDOW-CURRENT ...) from Lisp].
3. Kill the offending buffer.

This lets me define a function (which is just a big SELECTQ) for, e.g., lists which lets them
respond to the messages I want them to.  

Is there any chance that this (or a more efficient version) could be made the default
version of SEND?

	ZMail 48.7, microcode 216,  , on Ford Prefect:

	In a Lisp Listener I said:

	Multics' Chaosnet software was not working at the time, and the
	following printed out:

	This looks like an error object to me; why is it returning it instead of
	SIGNALing it?

    Read the System 91 (and rel 4.0) release notes.
    finger, whois, and some of the time parsing functions now return error objects, as
    these functions are called by many other functions, some of which handle the errors 
    themselves.  Perhaps if called from top level, the error should be SIGNALLED.


Ahem, I don't think it's really necessary to do the signalling.  (Or maybe
it's just a matter of personal taste.)  It is now the resposibility of
composite functions to singal; I guess some (CHAOS:FINGER and CHAOS:WHOIS,to
name two) were judged to be functions for which error instances were good
enough.  (In these respect they behave like other functions whose ERROR-P
arguments are T.)

One thing to discuss is how error instances print out in 91+.  Is there any
reason for them to PRINT READably ?  As a matter of fact, in this particular
example, the error instance can't be read in due to the #< which appears as
part of the host objects PRINTing out.

    I often find myself wanting to send messages to ordinary objects like lists, numbers,
    etc. ....
    Is there any chance that this (or a more efficient version) could be made the default
    version of SEND?

Sending messages to non-instances has been on the long-term task list for a
long time.  It's always been of relatively low priority, though.  "more
efficient" is the problem; it's important that SEND to instances be
open-coded, because otherwise it would have to fool around with &REST
arguments and LEXPR-FUNCALL.  (Not even to mention the two calls to TYPEP and
the COPYLIST that were in the example in your mail.)  This means we can't just
change the SEND function to make a type check.  Now, if you don't require your
function to be named SEND (in other words all you want is a dispatching
facility, and you don't need it to cooperate with the flavor system), you can
just use your function, call it foo, and not worry that fooing to a number is
much less efficient than sending to an instance.  If you really need to name
it SEND, and you want to know when we will implement this, well, it's still
lower priority than a long list of more important things, and it requires
microcode-level work, so it probably can't happen soon.

Well, there is a conceivable reason for error instances to be printed readably
in 91 -- error instances in 91 can be re-signalled.  You might want to do
something else with the instance.

Of course, if the particular instance won't read anyway, it's pointless.

To make a function name mouse sensitive on a ZWEI:EDITOR-TYPEOUT-WINDOW, you
have to send the window a :ITEM message. Wouldn't it be better if the handler
for PRIN1's to that window (which gets called when you ~S something to the 
window) just watched for the case of things that are FBOUNDP going out and
made anything that was PRIN1'd to that window and FBOUNDP be mouse sensitive?
Would that be a tremendous lot of overhead? The result would be really neat.
Then code could just do 
 (format t "The function ~S does such-and-so" 'CAR)
and have the CAR be mouse-sensitive AND they could still call that code from
a window that didn't have mouse-sensitive things and win. If they had reason
to suppress mouse-sensitivity, they could bind some var and/or do 
something like
 (format t "The function ~A does such and so" (format nil "~S" 'CAR))
It would also be able to then watch for other kinds of things that should
be mouse-sensitive that the user hadn't thought to make mouse-sensitive (eg,
variables, things with fun properties, ... whatever it could cheaply and

If I have done (SEND STANDARD-OUTPUT ':ITEM 'ZWEI:FUNCTION-NAME 'FOO)
to a ZWEI:EDITOR-TYPEOUT-WINDOW and the window has become correctly
sensitive to the function name it's holding onto in that place, then
doing m-. lets me point at functions in the buffer but not at these
things on the typeout window.

One might suggest that it's better to not have the m-. arrow be able
to touch the items in the typeout window because they can have lots
of things done to them directly (without the m-.) but given that I've
typed the m-., it seems clear to me that I'm trying to name a function
and I should be able to point at any copy of that function on the screen
that I can.

Further, I note that while in the initial mouse-items part of m-.,
I can still get a pop-up menu on the mouse sensitive function names from 
a typeout window (arglist, disassemble, etc.) but when I click on, for 
example, arglist nothing happens. I find this behavior relatively confusing.

Is it really a documented feature that these two forms are not
equivalent?  I like KMP's idea, but think that it would be better to use
a mechanism that was more obvious in meaning, such as a new FORMAT
control:
 (format t "The function ~M does such and so" 'CAR)

~M tries to print the item mouse-sensitively, being equivalent to ~S if
the stream does not support mouse-sensitive items.  This has several
advantages: it is obvious to the reader that the item is expected to be
moused, and it also allows one to use a consistent mechanism for
outputing non-FBOUND things that are mouse-sensitive.

    Subject: Idea for ZWEI internals
    To: BUG-LISPM at OZ

    To make a function name mouse sensitive on a ZWEI:EDITOR-TYPEOUT-WINDOW, you
    have to send the window a :ITEM message. Wouldn't it be better if the handler
    for PRIN1's to that window (which gets called when you ~S something to the 
    window) just watched for the case of things that are FBOUNDP going out and
    made anything that was PRIN1'd to that window and FBOUNDP be mouse sensitive?
    Would that be a tremendous lot of overhead? The result would be really neat.
    Then code could just do 
     (format t "The function ~S does such-and-so" 'CAR)
    and have the CAR be mouse-sensitive AND they could still call that code from
    a window that didn't have mouse-sensitive things and win. If they had reason
    to suppress mouse-sensitivity, they could bind some var and/or do 
    something like
     (format t "The function ~A does such and so" (format nil "~S" 'CAR))
    It would also be able to then watch for other kinds of things that should
    be mouse-sensitive that the user hadn't thought to make mouse-sensitive (eg,
    variables, things with fun properties, ... whatever it could cheaply and
    usefully compute).
    -kmp

While you're at it, you might as well make it so an arbitrary predicate on
a symbol (other objects too?) can determine the mouse sensitivity, instead of
just FBOUNDP.

In Release 4.0, Spire 6.3, site configuration 11, on Lisp Machine Six:

This backtrace is from typing alt in c-X c-F with a VX: default.  The
software shouldn't try to complete against filesystems that don't
support the option, or at least should catch and handle gracefully the
error.

When loading patches, it would be useful to have a procede option which
punted loading patches for that particular system.

Subject: The Case of the Vanishing Release Info

In Release 4.0, System 222.151, Hardcopy 11.13, Zmail 74.34, LMFS 30.18,
site configuration 12, on Lisp Machine Twenty-two:

In a fresh Release 4.1 band (not 4.0!), I did (LOAD-PATCHES). It 
loaded only
 SYS: SYS; RELEASE QBIN >
 SYS: SITE; VERSION LISP >
and then claimed to be a Release 4.0.

The variable SI:*RELEASES* now contains only entries for (3 0) and (4 0).

Perhaps we have a stale RELEASE QBIN?

It seems to me, though, that things could be made smarter. Couldn't
information always be conditionally PUSH'd onto that list rather than
just clobbering the variable with some new value so that it could only
get longer?

Yes, apparently when the Rel 4.1 band was installed, the RELEASE file
wasn't copied over, probably because the patch-copying tools haven't
been updated to know to do so.  HIC complained about this recently, as
well.  Anyway, I copied over the latest version, and the tools should
be fixed.

At the moment, the inspector always puts the array index (on the left side
on the screen) in base 10. regardless of the current value of BASE.  Would
anyone object if this were changed so that the array index would be
displayed in the current base?

In 93.4 ...

I'm not sure how much I like the new borders around Lisp listeners.  I think it
looks very spiffy and all that, but I've always thought it nice that MIT didn't
do it because it made it easier for me to tell instantly whether I was in a
Lisp listener or in Zwei, which is functionally very useful, when you think
about it.  Strange how you occasionally discover that all along you've been
depending on some cue without realizing it.

As far as human engineering goes, I think distinctiveness is very important;
the most commonly used windows should look so different from one another that
an instantaneous glance should tell one where one is.  Zmail is very
distinctive-looking; the Inspector and Peek are also.  Lisp listeners and Zwei
used to be.

Perhaps thickening the border between the echo area and the buffer panes
(currently only single-width, as opposed to double-width around the outsides of
the panes) would do it.  Or how about a reverse-video or bold-font modeline
(possibly an ugly idea), or something like that?

running system 91 

Often when I make an error, I know exactly what it
is and would like to abort the error handler quickly.

This, unfortunately, is impossible until it has printed out its
shlock.

Proposal:  Make the error handler listen for a cntl-z or <abort>
while it is tracing down the error.

Subject:  Compiler bug(?)
To: BUG-LISPM @ MIT-ML

I am having trouble getting the following function to compile. It used
to compile, but now I get an error, and I have NOT changed its code.
Here is the function and the error I get from the Lispmachine.


;RIGHT-PROC processes the RIGHT side of a rule (found in the 
;NLP global variable RIGHT)
(DEFUN RIGHT-PROC NIL
   (PROG (RESULT)
	 (SETQ RESULT NIL)  ;initialize local variable
     HOP (POP RIGHT SEG-TYPE)  ;the first token in RIGHT is the SEGment TYPE
                               ;SEG-TYPE is an NLP global variable
         (COND ((EQUAL (CAR RIGHT) '|(|)  ;are there creation specifications?
        	(POP RIGHT)  ;throw away |(|
	        (SETQ RESULT
		      (APPEND1 RESULT
			       (LIST SEG-TYPE (CREATION))))
     ;CREATION will generate the LISP code for the creation specifications
	        (POP RIGHT))  ;throw away |)|
	       (T (SETQ RESULT  ;otherwise just process the SEG-TYPE
			(APPEND1 RESULT
				 (LIST SEG-TYPE)))))
	 ;(AND RIGHT (GO HOP)) is there more to process? then do it
         (RETURN (SETQ RIGHT RESULT))))  ;save the answer in RIGHT


>>TRAP 5503. (ARGTYP NUMBER M-T 1. QIEQL0)
The second argument to =, NIL, was of the wrong type.
The function expected a number.
While in the function COMPILER:PEEP-ONE-SPOT  COMPILER:PEEP-WHOLE-FUNCTION  COMPILER:PEEP
Error occurred while compiling RIGHT-PROC
COMPILER:PEEP-ONE-SPOT: (P.C. = 1120)
   Arg 0 (INDEX): 25.
Warning: the default cons area is COMPILER:FASD-TEMPORARY-AREA

Commands available for this particular error:

s-A, <RESUME>: Asks for a replacement argument and proceeds.
s-B, <ABORT>: Return to top level in Lisp Listener 2.
s-C:          Restart process Lisp Listener 2.

It seems that the penultimate line
  (AND RIGHT (GO HOP))  ;is there more to process? then do it
is causing the error. When I remove this line, the function compiles.
However, when I try to compile a function like 

(DEFUN KLUDGE NIL
  (PROG NIL
    HOP (SETQ FRIZZ FROZZ)
        (AND RIGHT (GO HOP))))

the compiler works. Can anyone tell me what's going on, and what I
have to do to get the compiler to work on this function, or how to
avoid this problem in future? Thanks.

Subject: GMSGS, GMSGS-server, SYSMSG, FORUM, MSGS, SMDATE, et al.


GMSGS has been redone a bit.  It now takes just about all the options
that the ITS version does, including re/MAILing the messages, specifying
an arbitrary output file, and so on.  For full gory details, read the
help file available by @HELP GMSGS or in HLP:GMSGS.HLP

For LispM users:  The same GMSGS is running as a server.  You can have
the messages dumped in your MAIL.TXT (or ZMAIL.TXT if /ZMAIL specified)
by a simple transaction;  just send as arguments to the RFC the username
of the person whose messages you want (and another options), and you'll
get back an ANS with some string like "[There are messages]", or a CLS
with an approriate error string.



There have been a few changes made in these programs:

SYSMSG, FORUM, and MSGS are all instances of the same program; you'll
notice that they prompt you with "--Msgs--" and "--More--" instead of
"[Msgs]" and "[More]", and will accept <space> for a positive answer.

SYSMSG reads the mail to System, but can be told to check others
by specifying their names as keywords or switches, e.g.

@SYSMSG /FORUM or @SYSMSG FORUM

Likewise, FORUM can read system messages by

@FORUM /SYSMSG or @FORUM SYSMSG

To read all of the known BBoards, as @MSGS does, you can specify ALL
or /ALL.  The difference between @MSGS and @SYSMSG /ALL is that @MSGS
will type out the name of the BBoard before the first --Msgs-- prompt
in each BBoard.

/NOISY will give you messages like "[No Forum messages]" and such, if
you like to know that it's actually doing something.


@SMDATE takes the same set of keywords as SYSMSG and friends.  By
default, it sets the last-read date for System messages, but you can
have it do other BBoards by specifying their names (in which case it
will do only those ones), or ALL for all of them.  Also, you can give
it a DATE&TIME, just a DATE (time defaults to one second after
midnight), or just a TIME (date defaults to today), or "-nn" which
says to set the read dats to nn days ago.  If no date or time is
specified, it defaults to *now*.  For example,

@SMDATE /FORUM -7

Sets the last-read date for the FORUM BBoard to 7 days ago;

@SMDATE 1-Jan-83 ALL

@SMDATE 12:0:0

etc.

The GMSGS server on OZ uses a slightly different protocol than the one
on ITS does; the GMSGS commands which come with ZMAIL won't work on it.

I have written a new little ZMAIL command which runs the GMSGS server
on OZ.  It will get the messages into your inbox buffer, or have them
remailed to you.  The source file to load is OZ:PS:<LMLIB>GMSGS.LISP.
You can compile it in your favorite system; I dont know why it should
not work in all.  Bugs to me.

    In-reply-to: The message of 17 Feb 1983 12:34-EST from Patrick Sobalvarro <PGS>

    I really don't want to see 12 pages of backtrace.
    It makes it useless to use TYPE on my mail file.
    Is there some way to control how much gets put in the message?

The easiest solution would be to remove yourself from BUG-LISPM.
A number of people put dummy accounts on mailing lists, which
mail to a separate inbox, so that they can choose to read their
personal mail separately from their mailing-list mail.

This machine requires a tvspeed of 60. instead of the default 60.5.  When I do a
set-tv-speed, the machine gets wedged and requires a warm boot to get started
again. (this happened twice)

Another unrelated problem that has only happened once (did not try a second
time): I read in a couple of files from mc (these were the first files I had
read in at all) then tried reading in files from oz but got the message "no such
device oz:ps:<cm.sym>sym.lisp" or something like that.  I gave up trying, cold
booted and read in my oz files first with no problems.

    I too, would prefer shorter bug reports. How 'bout having Meta-X Bug
    write the backtrace to a file instead?

This seems like too much of a pain to me.  If I were maintaining a system and
had to look in a file to find the backtrace every time I wanted to check out
a bug, I'd be pretty unthrilled.  BUG-LISPM is the mailing list one reports
Lisp Machine bugs to.  The people who read it do so because they want to fix
the bugs; that is the primary purpose of the list.  People who read it for
pleasure should not complain because occasionally there is a long backtrace
in it; sometimes all that information is necessary, and the purpose of the
mailing list is to provide that information to people who need it.

Besides, Babyl takes almost no time to come up on Oz.

    Do you really mean that you think the compiler shouldn't complain here, or is
    this a braino?

Well, I guess as stated it perhaps its ok, but I should have stated that
the form was inside an eval-when and it still complained.  
What I'm saying is yes, strictly speaking, in some cases this is really only
an append of one form, but I think its kind of silly to have to say 
(append 'a #+symbolics 'b #-symbolics nil)

Anyway, I ran into trouble trying to load-time conditionalize the evaluation of
that form; none of the ps:<hdt>bar.lisp files seem to work.
  ;;Yes, some of them are typos, but the last bar.lisp.7 has me confused, at least
in system 93.5

In-Reply-To:  Message of 19 February 1983 01:27 est from Howard D. Trachtman

This is not really the problem you're trying to solve, but can I ask you
why this code is trying to APPEND symbols?

In the case of bar.lisp.7, you have the EVAL-WHEN inside a function
definition.  What the H-ll is that supposed to mean?  I believe that
EVAL-WHEN is only useful at top-level.  In any case, a non-top-level
EVAL-WHEN is just coded as a call to the EVAL-WHEN function, so it
conditionalizes on when it is called, and it will only execute if EVAL
is specified.

What do you mean by "load-time conditionalize the evaluation of that
form"?  There is no form being executed, just a function being defined.
Exactly what is it you are trying to conditionalize, and WHY?

OK, some changes have been made, for compatability with ITS: GMSGS
opens a full connection, and will accept a filespec in place of a
username.  It takes all the other switches and randomness that the
interactive one does, and sends back all the same output (primary
input and output are just reset to the Chaos JFNs).  One note: There
must be a <space> or <CR> or <LF> or some TWENEX terminating character
after the last field, since the COMND call that is parsing up the
input line does not understand 215's to be EOL (the automatic 8->7bit
character conversion has yet to be implimented, alas).  If there is no
ending terminator, the last field will be missed entirely.

Er, what does APPEND mean called on symbols in your software?  In ours
it is an error.

BTW, (APPEND '(A B C)) works fine in Brand S interpreter;
I assume it does in the LMI/RMS system as well.  It seems to me
that a warning for this in the compiler is gratuitous.

In system 91.37, microcode version 204. When an AREF or ASET is done on a multi-dimensional
array with fewer than the required number of subscripts, the error handler reads in 
a DTP-TRAP word from somewhere, and does not retain a pointer to the stack frame that the
error came from. If the aref was not made from top-level, aborting from the error 
handler causes an illop.

    NIL is not invalid as a menu item.  You're allowed to use it, and it's
    supposed to do that.  See the documentation.

Dan's reply is misinformation.  The documentation says nothing about NIL.
The bug is that internally there are variables that are either the menu
item the mouse is pointing at, or NIL if it isn't pointing at anything.  So
NIL as a menu item isn't allowed.  The code could be fixed to complain if
you use NIL as a menu item, but that seems fairly pointless.

The documentation should be fixed.  The new documentation could point out
that rather than (TV:MENU-CHOOSE '(T NIL)) you probably wanted
(TV:MENU-CHOOSE '(("Yes" . T) ("No" . NIL))).

I think it is completely clear that he means that if the buffer contains

(defmethod (foo bar) ...,

you point to (foo bar).  I have wanted this a million times.  I used to
always wonder how the editor, with mouse-moves real-time response, could
determine which things in its buffer were functions (visions of real fast
parsing) as the mouse moved for Meta-Dot.  Given that it could do that,
I saw little reason why it did not "know" about the S-expression following
"(defmethod ".  I was sorely disappointed when DLW explained to me how
ZWEI does this magic, namely words in the text are mouse-sensitive 
depending upon their fboundp-ness, even if they appear in comments!  In 
this scenario, it is indeed hard to get what Henry wants.

Nevertheless, the inability to trace methods by mousing at them, and the
resultant need to type long complicated not-quite-function specs, is a
real and visible deficiency.

There probably should be a site option that specifies whether the site
is in a location that uses daylight savings time.  As a specific case, I
happen to know that Arizona does not use daylight savings time, so you
should do this before you sell one there.  In fact, at some point you
should parametrize the decision of whether it is the appropriate time of
year, as there are countries which implement daylight savings time but
do not change on the same days as we do.  This will probably be hard to
do, so you might just want to provide several daylight-savings-time-p
functions for well-known countries which are dispatched from a site
option.

    Dan's reply is misinformation.  The documentation says nothing about NIL.
    The bug is that internally there are variables that are either the menu
    item the mouse is pointing at, or NIL if it isn't pointing at anything.  So
    NIL as a menu item isn't allowed.  The code could be fixed to complain if
    you use NIL as a menu item, but that seems fairly pointless.

    The documentation should be fixed.  The new documentation could point out
    that rather than (TV:MENU-CHOOSE '(T NIL)) you probably wanted
    (TV:MENU-CHOOSE '(("Yes" . T) ("No" . NIL))).

    Document name: Lisp Machine Choice Facilities

I would prefer if (TV:MENU-CHOOSE '(FOO NIL BAR NIL)) offered only FOO and BAR
as choices. This would mean, among other things, that one could do
(TV:MENU-CHOOSE (LIST (IF condition some-menu-item)
	              some-other-menu-item
	              ...))
and have only the non-NIL items actually appear. Such behavior could be useful
enough to even call it a feature ... certainly it would be better to not show
the NIL than to show it as something not mouse-sensitive.

	    In the editor, when you do Meta-X Trace, it would be nice if you
	    could point to methods like you can point to the names of functions
	    to trace the method.
    you point to (foo bar).  I have wanted this a million times.  I was sorely
    disappointed when DLW explained to me how
    ZWEI does this magic, namely words in the text are mouse-sensitive 
    depending upon their fboundp-ness, even if they appear in comments!
It's a big win that you can point to function names in comments, in
documentation, and in mail (if you have the mail in Zmacs).  So it's really
better that it doesn't totally-parse the screen you're pointing at.

The editor could easily recognize pointing to parentheses and mouse-ify
the whole parenthesized expression.  That was on my white board for months
until my whiteboard got full.  I don't think it takes me to do this, although
I did want to remodularize that part of the editor at the same time, to get
rid of several kludges and misbehaviors it has.

    There probably should be a site option that specifies whether the site
    is in a location that uses daylight savings time.  As a specific case, I
    happen to know that Arizona does not use daylight savings time, so you
    should do this before you sell one there.  In fact, at some point you
    should parametrize the decision of whether it is the appropriate time of
    year, as there are countries which implement daylight savings time but
    do not change on the same days as we do.  This will probably be hard to
    do, so you might just want to provide several daylight-savings-time-p
    functions for well-known countries which are dispatched from a site
    option.

Depending on your LispMachine's current position in spacetime there are an
amazing number of adjustments that can conceivably be applied to GMT to
obtain the local time.  There are timezones that differ from GMT by an odd
number of half-hours, and I have even heard it claimed that there are some
15 min. timezones somewhere!  The best general solution might be to allow an
arbitrary piece of code to interface between GMT and the local natives.
Sort of like what you have to do for pathnames.

Now that each ZMacs window has its own process, so you can edit while an
editor is broken, is there any reason why Control-M in the debugger,
(mail) and (bug) should enter those stupid standalone editor panes,
rather than a ZMacs?  I find the lack of certain commands (like file

Subject: Question: ZMAIL mailing vs ZWEI mailing.
To: info-lispm at MIT-OZ

In ZWEI, mailing with the C-X M command separates the headers and text
with a line --Text Follows This Line--.  In ZMAIL, when the headers and
text are in the same window, they are separated by a blank line.

Many people have complained about the difference between ZWEI and
ZMAIL in this regard, so I would like to make them the same.
My question is, which of the two ways do people prefer?
Should a blank line separate them, or should a line that says
what it does separate them?

I was trying to get into that split screen window, had some problems and
discovered this error.  I'm not sure exactly when it happended.  I think there
is yet another message, which I will mail next.

I was doing a HOSTAT, and it seemed that host 17044 responded to STATUS
with just `a'.  When it tried (chaos:finger "@CHAOS|1700"), I got a
remote network error saying that Afghan was not available as a server.
I think Afghan's idea of a real server is a little mixed-up.
