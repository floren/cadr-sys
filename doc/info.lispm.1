  I wrote a simple function that creates a temporary

file with your new mail, or both.  I was considering making
this function callable from a terminal key, to greatly
decrease the time required to read your mail.

 The question is: do people think it would be worthwhile

If you are running diagnostics or debugging other machines in CC,
OZ:SRC:<L.UBIN> contains the neccessary microloads (MEMD, UCADR).

Many times people try to salvage editor buffers (with
CC:SALVAGE-EDITOR), but they lose because their machine cannot
find the right microcode.  This happens when the machines are not
running the same software.  The microload directory is
EE:LIB:<LISPM.UBIN> for Symbolics, OZ:SRC:<L.UBIN> for MIT.
These should be substituted for each other, or for SYS: UBIN; as
alternative pathnames after a FNF (file not found) error.  You
might have to use the c-N, C-P, c-m-R, and (eh-arg n) features of
the debugger to get the file loaded correctly.  (This is
neccessary for the :WHY command in CC.)

I hacked up ISPELL on OZ to run as a server, so that poor LM's can feed it

Send it a data packet (opcode 200)at a time of words separated by
spaces or newlines, and you will get back 1-n data packets followed by
an EOF packet.  The results you get are, for each word, one of

	"T" if the word was found directly (as in SLOW) or indirectly
	    (as in SLOWLY or SLOWER)

	"(choice1 choice2 ... choiceN)" if the word was not found, but
	    ISPELL had some suggestions

or
	"NIL" if it was not found, and there were no close matches.

followed by a blank.

-------

If you send "now is the time for all good qgirhu to coem to"

you will get back

"T T T T T T T NIL T (POEM COME) T"

-------

When you are done sending text, just send an EOF packet and it will
go away (in fact, it will go away if it gets ANYTHING but a data
packet)



Does this scheme sound reasonable?

Experimental Local-File version 41 is now available.  Bugs to BUG-LMFS.

In addition to fixing the problem of subdirectories not being correctly
saved, some changes were made:

* Undeletable files are now supported.  Deleted files don't go away
  unless explicitly expunged.  This means that booting the file system
  or the machine also doesn't expunge anything.  There is no current
  "system expunge" function implemented.

* The root directory is now a real directory.  It can be specified by
  either LM:; or LM:<>.  For compatibility reasons, it cannot contain
  arbitrary files, only other directories.

* A new function, FS:DBG-EDIT, has been implemented.  This function
  allows you to treewalk the file system directory structure and change
  certain things.  It is intended to help you when aborting out of a
  file operation leaves a file incorrectly closed or deleted, or just to
  examine the directory structure in a way independent of the pathname
  system.

* Some of the "user" functions, such as LM-CREATE-DIRECTORY, had their
  names changed.  This shouldn't affect anyone who only uses the
  standard pathname/stream interface.

OZ:SRC:<L.FILE>FSDOC.TEXT.

I realize that the <Delete> key does not normally do anything anywhere,

in the rubout handler.   Its not immediately clear (to me) what the right
thing is, but delete wiping out the last character in ZWEI and the input
buffer in the rubout handler even thought that's not compatable.

Anyone want to put in there two bits as to what this key should do?

What do people think that the <Quote> key should do in general
and in ZWEI?  I think it would be nice if all the keys which 
aren't defined do something, as it seems that for most of them
there's a reasonable thing for them to do.  Saving them for
a "great idea later to come" isn't a valid argument, for if

then that will be used if its really so much better.

    The quote key sounds like an excellent place to install control-q.
    As for DELETE, perhaps it could be made synonymous with rubout, for people
    used to the erase key being on the other side.

    				James

Great for ZWEI, but what should they do elsewhere?  It probably 
would be a win for quote in an input stream to insert the next 
character into the buffer, with all of its bucky bits.  That's
the same thing in zwei, except that it doesn't exactly do
a control-q.  

Now I suppose that Macro in ZWEI should do a ^X ( if you
are not typing in a kbd-macro and ^X ) if you are.
I suppose if you're in a macro already you could type
control-macro to recursively define a kbd-macro.

To: INFO-LISPM at MIT-OZ

System 222 is now released to users.  It goes with microcode 977.  LOD4
of LM6 (222.57) contains the official release band.  Unfortunately a
couple of the bands I used while debugging the release software were
copied to a other machines before this announcement.  Although I think I
destroyed all of them, there may still be some lurking in the shadows,
beware.

Updated release notes are in OZ:SRC:<S.DOC>RELEASE-4.TEXT.  Hardcopies
of the release notes will be available in large quantities as soon as they
are printed.  System 222 is being released early to beta-test sites; in
a few weeks it will be renamed to Release 4 and sent to all Symbolics
sites.

There are very few changes in 222 since 218.  The only major change is a
remodularization of the Hardcopy software (the long promised "New
Hardcopy System").  Most programs which ran in 218 should run without
change in 222.  Experimental System 218 had a number of fairly serious
problems, and should no longer be used.

A major change affecting MIT users in this release is that OZ is now the
SYS host for symbolics systems.  The sources are kept in a hierarchy
under SRC:<S>, and patches and sources will be updated between MIT
and SCRC periodically.  The sources on EE will continue be updated
infrequently, but should be considered read-only to make life easier for
me when merging files.  We hope that this move is more conducive to
co-operation between the MIT community and Symbolics.  The move to OZ does
not, however, reflect any policy change:  software modifications made at
customer sites are still subject to audit, and everyone is expected to
abide by the software agreements between MIT and Symbolics.

If there are any questions, please addess them to BUG-LISPM@MIT-OZ.

I am considering an incompatible change to the way these flavors

trivial but incompatible changes every place they are DIRECTLY used,
and I want to find out how much this would impact the users.

The official Symbolics Release 4.0 band for the LM-2 (and CADR) is now
available, and should supplant the earlier versions distributed.  It has
been newly compressed, and takes less room than patched earlier
versions.  (19900 pages).  Also, it goes with microcode 979, which has
some bug fixes.

It consists of System 222.140, Zmail 74.28, LMFS 30.15, Hardcopy 11.12,
and Tape 13.0.  This configuration is displayed in the herald as simply
"Release 4.0".  Any systems which are patched beyond this level will
still be listed separately in the herald.  The comment on the disk
label is "Rel 4.0".

The final 4.0 version of the 3600 software is not yet available.

There is a copy on LM16, configured for MIT.

Enjoy.

Please LOGOUT explicitly from OZ when SUPDUPing or TELNETing.  When you 
don't you can create a detached job that eats a jobs slot that can
keep your fellow earthers from logging in.  This is especially
important to do during the day when jobs slots for file serving and
net-hopping are at a premium.

In-reply-to: The message of 27 Jan 83 23:28-EST from Martin David Connor <MARTY at MIT-MC>

It is more subtle than you think.  Note that some LispM users use
Network-L to log out.  This sends the SUPDUP logout sequence (and
probably does nothing in TELNET).  This works on ITS, which correctly
understands the SUPDUP sequence.  TWENEX can't do much about it (now),
so the best it can do is detach.  Therefore,

(1) TWENEX should be fixed (good luck, since this brings up some of the
    same issues that terminal location brings up), and
(2) People who use Network-L on TWENEX should try and change their
    habbits.

Subject: GMSGS, GMSGS-server, SYSMSG, FORUM, MSGS, SMDATE, et al.


GMSGS has been redone a bit.  It now takes just about all the options
that the ITS version does, including re/MAILing the messages, specifying
an arbitrary output file, and so on.  For full gory details, read the
help file available by @HELP GMSGS or in HLP:GMSGS.HLP

For LispM users:  The same GMSGS is running as a server.  You can have
the messages dumped in your MAIL.TXT (or ZMAIL.TXT if /ZMAIL specified)
by a simple transaction;  just send as arguments to the RFC the username
of the person whose messages you want (and another options), and you'll
get back an ANS with some string like "[There are messages]", or a CLS
with an approriate error string.



There have been a few changes made in these programs:

SYSMSG, FORUM, and MSGS are all instances of the same program; you'll
notice that they prompt you with "--Msgs--" and "--More--" instead of
"[Msgs]" and "[More]", and will accept <space> for a positive answer.

SYSMSG reads the mail to System, but can be told to check others
by specifying their names as keywords or switches, e.g.

@SYSMSG /FORUM or @SYSMSG FORUM

Likewise, FORUM can read system messages by

@FORUM /SYSMSG or @FORUM SYSMSG

To read all of the known BBoards, as @MSGS does, you can specify ALL
or /ALL.  The difference between @MSGS and @SYSMSG /ALL is that @MSGS
will type out the name of the BBoard before the first --Msgs-- prompt
in each BBoard.

/NOISY will give you messages like "[No Forum messages]" and such, if
you like to know that it's actually doing something.


@SMDATE takes the same set of keywords as SYSMSG and friends.  By
default, it sets the last-read date for System messages, but you can
have it do other BBoards by specifying their names (in which case it
will do only those ones), or ALL for all of them.  Also, you can give
it a DATE&TIME, just a DATE (time defaults to one second after
midnight), or just a TIME (date defaults to today), or "-nn" which
says to set the read dats to nn days ago.  If no date or time is
specified, it defaults to *now*.  For example,

@SMDATE /FORUM -7

Sets the last-read date for the FORUM BBoard to 7 days ago;

@SMDATE 1-Jan-83 ALL

@SMDATE 12:0:0

etc.

OK, some changes have been made, for compatability with ITS: GMSGS
opens a full connection, and will accept a filespec in place of a
username.  It takes all the other switches and randomness that the
interactive one does, and sends back all the same output (primary
input and output are just reset to the Chaos JFNs).  One note: There
must be a <space> or <CR> or <LF> or some TWENEX terminating character
after the last field, since the COMND call that is parsing up the
input line does not understand 215's to be EOL (the automatic 8->7bit
character conversion has yet to be implimented, alas).  If there is no
ending terminator, the last field will be missed entirely.

In ZWEI, mailing with the C-X M command separates the headers and text

text are in the same window, they are separated by a blank line.

Many people have complained about the difference between ZWEI and
ZMAIL in this regard, so I would like to make them the same.
My question is, which of the two ways do people prefer?
Should a blank line separate them, or should a line that says
what it does separate them?

Subject: The last word on GMSGS (don't you dare reply to this message!)


OK, ok...  noone's ever happy.  Here's the final word on the Twenex GMSGS
server.

Since it's supposed to be compatible with the ITS one, it takes the same
set of arguments:  To specify the user whose messages are to be gotten,
give his username, or a filespec (the directory is the username (sigh)).

The default messages to get are the System ones.  You can specify FORUM
or /FORUM to get those (currently the only other BBD we use), or ALL or
/ALL to get all BBDs.

The stuff is put by default in PS:<username>MAIL.TXT, but if you specify
/ZMAIL, it goes in PS:<username>ZMAIL.TXT;  if you say /INTO you can then
specify an arbitrary output file.

The /MAIL switch remails all the messages through the mailer, so that
any bizarre forwarding you are doing will work.

/NOISY and /SILENT control how much output the thing sends back to you.
Normally you'll get "[There are messages]" or "[No messages]", but with
/SILENT you get nothing.  I can't remember what /NOISY does... I just
remember that it prints out more junk in cases where it wouldn't
normally.


I kludged around having to put some sort of terminator at the end of
the command line, so do whatever silly things you want... put a CR or
a NEWLINE or nothing... It don't care...  It equally and fairly mutilates
EVERYTHING you give it.


That's it.   Don't send bug reports....

Subject: Functions MAIL and DIRED now use ZMACS.
To: info-lispm at MIT-OZ

Starting in 93.15, the functions MAIL and DIRED now use a ZMACS
frame to do the editing, rather than a special-purpose window.
They know how to find a ZMACS frame which is idle waiting for
commands, or to create one if necessary.

Some of the advantages include the ability to switch from
the one directory or message to other things without any more
window switching.  However, there are various reasons people
might not like this--I can't tell.  Therefore, there is a variable
ZWEI:*MAIL-AND-DIRED-USE-ZMACS*, which if set to NIL brings
back the old behavior.

I would like to know whether anyone dislikes the new way,
and, if so, why.  I would like to flush the complexity of
providing the old way if nobody can point to a reason for it.
Or make it the default again if there is a reason for it.

Subject: ZWEI Undo command (C-Shift-U)
To: info-lispm-mit@MIT-OZ

I've found that few people know about the new ZWEI unlimited Undo feature.
This feature is simply that you can undo all the changes you
have made to a buffer since you read in or saved a file,
one batch of contiguous changes at a time, by typing C-Shift-U
over and over again.

Absolutely all changes are recorded.  For example, you can
undo a Query Replace, or part of one.  Each C-Shift-U gets
one replacement.

If you undo too far, type C-Shift-R to redo the changes undone.
One C-Shift-R cancels one C-Shift-U.

If you set ZWEI:*DISCARD-UNDO-INFO-ON-SAVING* to NIL,
you can undo all the way to when you visited the file,
regardless of whether you have saved it.

I found that it required an effort at first to remember
to consider using the command, but once I had developed the
habit it was a great saver.

Subject: CADR-4 move

CADR-4 has moved to the seventh floor.  This is partially because the
console moved out of the lounge when the lounge became an office, and
a number of people felt that it would be under-utilized in RG's
office.  It was hoped that because the seventh floor is warmer and
quieter than the ninth floor, CADR-4 would get more use there.  It was
also done because the Music Group wanted to put some special-purpose
hardware on one of the general-use AI Lab machines, for use as a
backup for their own machine.

Despite the fact that CADR-4 has moved to the seventh floor and a
piece of special hardware (a synthesizer) will be attached to it, it
remains a general AI lab resource.  The console will be in the alcove
near 797, where CADR6 is now, and CADR6's console will be moved to the
hammock station.  Just as before, any AI Lab member has as much right
to its use as any other AI Lab member, including members of the Music
Group.  No AI Lab member should attempt to punt any other AI Lab
member from it.  In this respect it is like CADR-6, which, despite the
fact that it is a general AI lab machine, also has special hardware on
it (an FPS array processor).  While the music group will possibly
attach synthesizer hardware to other 7th floor machines in the future
(e.g. CADR6 or CADR33), these too would remain general AI lab machines
like CADR4.

CADR-7's T-300 disk will be swapped for CADR-4's T-80 so that a music
band can fit on CADR-4 in addition to fresh bands.  We hope that its
having moved to a more comfortable location will encourage increased
use of the machine.

Subject: Recent MINITS changes
To: bug-minits@MIT-MC, bug-twenex@MIT-XX, info-lispm@MIT-OZ,
    network@SCRC-POINTER

It used to be the case that MINITS would read packets out of the chaos
board at process level instead of interrupt level.  It did this so it
would not spend excessive time at priority 5 frobbing the chaos board
and not being able to service 9600 baud interrupts (whether they be
DL-type or DUP-11).  Unfortunately, waiting for a process to schedule
would often cause many packets to get lost.  Much of this is no longer
true.

It now drops the priority to that before the interrupt happened and
services the interface immediately (with appropriate checks and locks).
This allows 9600 baud interrupts to still happen, but does not have the
scheduling latency.  For a LispM blasting packets to a MINITS as fast as
it can (e.g., using the MINITS SINK contact name), about 34% of the
packets used to get lost.  Now this number is about 2%.  This also
improves output traffic because the output interrupt will also get
serviced nearly immediately (providing the receiving end does not
delay).

When the new software propigates (I'll make an attempt to do the 4
PDP-20s tomorrow [Sunday]) the effect users will see include the
following:
 * Faster writing of files to TWENEX (e.g., writing a LispM editor
     buffer or a CFTP transfer)
 * Better bridging between subnets (especially from a chaos subnet to an
     ethernet subnet).
 * Perhaps better terminal response on concentrators due to less lost
     packets on both the concentrator and other MINITS bridges on the
     route to/from the mainframe.

It happens that the Common Lisp plan involves changing the function MEMBER
(and ASSOC and DELETE and REMOVE) to use EQL instead of EQUAL for comparison.
(EQL is like = on numbers, like EQ on everything else).

I have urged them to call the new functions MEMBERP and other new names
so that the old names MEMBER, ASSOC, etc. can be unchanged.

I expect most of you prefer to have the existing names not change their
meanings.  I'd like to know whether you think this is important.

Subject: Changes to MEMBER, ASSOC, etc.

RMS failed to note in his message the following relevant points.

* The proposed definitions for MEMBER, ASSOC, etc. are compatible with all
  the cases of the current ASSOC except in the case of searching for list
  or string in list structure. Since Maclisp has no strings, Maclisp 
  compatibility is affected only in the case where people do

	(MEMBER '(B C) '((A B) (B C) (C D)))

  which in Maclisp used to return ((B C) (C D)) and under the proposed 
  definition would return NIL. On the LispM, the additional case of doing


	(MEMBER "BAR" '("FOO" "BAR" "BAZ"))

  which used to return ("BAR" "BAZ") would return NIL. Under the proposed
  standard, this would return NIL.

* In both of the cases written above, you can simply mechanically rewrite 
  your code. eg,

	(MEMBER '(B C) '((A B) (B C) (C D)) :TEST #'EQUAL)
    or  (MEMBER "BAR"  '("FOO" "BAR" "BAZ") :TEST #'EQUAL)

  In the cases where you've written

	(MEMBER C '(#/A #/B #/C))
    or  (MEMBER N '(1 2 3 4))
    or  (MEMBER X '(1.0 2.0 3.0))

  you need change nothing, you'll just find that in some implementations your
  code may run a little faster.

  The only thing that's in question is what the default test is.

* The reason for changing the default test (which will be by a new function
  EQL, which is like EQ except it can also compare characters or numbers)
  is that it will allow searches for numbers and characters (which is believed
  to be the most common use of MEMBER) to be more conveniently expressed.
  eg, it used to be that

	(MEMQ C '(#/A #/B #/C #/D))

  was guaranteed to work only on the LispM because in Maclisp numbers were not
  necessarily EQ and could not be searched for in some cases by MEMQ. (It 
  happens to work in some cases, but not all of them). The only alternative
  previously was to write

	(MEMBER C '(#/A #/B #/C #/D))

  which compiles inefficiently because it invokes an EQUAL test rather than
  a simpler test. Similar arguments can be made about searching for flonums.

  In the rarer cases of searching for strings or s-expressions, the intent
  of the current proposed definition is that you'd then use the clumsier 
  case of (MEMBER thing list :TEST test), specifying #'EQUAL, #'STRING-EQUAL,
  or whatever.

The :TEST argument will remain; that functionality is not in question. The
real questions which RMS is getting at are the following two:

(A) If you had no code you were worried about keeping compatible and you were
    just writing code from scratch, do you think EQL or EQUAL would be the more
    reasonable default predicate for MEMBER to use.

(B) If you have code which you want to run as easily as possible, do you
    consider the cost of locating the places which require this small change 
    from (MEMBER x y) to (MEMBER x y :TEST #'EQUAL) to be too much of a price 
    to pay for item A.

    Keep in mind that this will likely not be the only incompatible change 
    proposed by Common Lisp, so if you're thinking about the binary question
    of "Will my code run without my messing with it?" there is a fair chance
    the answer will be no anyway.

Subject: KMP's message
To: info-lispm-mit@MIT-OZ

Please don't believe KMP's clarification of my question!
His facts are correct, but the question he clarified is not the one I asked.

Common Lisp has a nice set of sequence functions, with EQL the
default for the test.  That is no problem for us, except:
some of them have the same names as familiar old Lisp functions
which they are incompatible with.

KMP has raised the issue of how those sequence functions ought to
work, and (it seems to me) supported the Common Lisp proposals.  I
like them pretty well too, but that is a DIFFERENT ISSUE, which while
more interesting in itself has less impact on all our existing code.
It's also something that would require a much harder fight to change
(it's too late).  So discuss that question if you want to, but don't
be distracted by it from the one that is just barely NOT too late:

  Should certain function Common Lisp sequence functions,
  which may be useful, avoid having names that are the same as
  existing Lisp functions which they are not compatible with,
  just so that our old code does not break.

Given that member is often used on the lispm to check for strings in
things like menus, it seems that equal would be preferable.  The
crux of the issue seems to be the simplification of that code (and the
ability to leave old code unmodified) versus speed.

Those who would want to try out their code first hand to see what
"Common-Lisp" might do to it could use NIL on some of the local VAX's.
Other things such as incompatible "/" function and readtable have
interesting effects.  You can also see what happens to numerical code
in cases which were previously errors, such as (SQRT -1) which now
returns #C(0.0 1.0), a complex number.

Another problem area is the changes to the semantics of property list
functions, which are unfortunately not completely specified!

As of now I am trying to track down some subtle Macsyma bugs (not causing
errors, just wrong results) which might be due to differences that I
did not predict beforehand. Its a lot of fun, really.

Subject: Memberp


The comments that I have received on the MEMBERP issue indicate that,
with the exception of Chuck Hedrick (and RMS himself), none of the
people responsible for Common Lisp implementation efforts believe that
it is a good idea to adopt RMS's changes in MEMBER and friends.  Three
different sets of reasons have been offered by the people responding:

1. People are not convinced that changing MEMBER to use EQL makes
substantially more trouble for RMS and his users than changing MEMBER to
MEMBERP would make for the rest of us, despite RMS's argument that we
could go on using our version of MEMBER.

2. The original reasons why we chose to make this change (regularity in
the choice of names leading to much less confusion in the long run) are
still valid.

3. Frozen is frozen.  It's hard enough to get consensus without
reopening the debate every time someone wakes up and notices something
he doesn't like.

Even if we discount the opinions of the Symbolics people, who might be
imagined to have political reasons for opposing RMS in this, the clear
majority still seems to favor leaving the manual as it is, with MEMBER
using EQL.  As far as I'm concerned, that's the end of it.  I hope that
RMS will choose to remain compatible with Common Lisp despite this
decision, but that's up to him.  All of us have had to make some major
compromises in the course of this effort, and so far everyone has stayed
aboard.

Now you know how much they care.  Anyway, I will change MEMBER or leave
it the same as the MIT system users prefer.

Subject: MEMBER


Recently RMS polled asked the opinion of people on this list about the
plan to change the definition of MEMBER in Common Lisp.  Some of the
responses indicated some confusion as to what we (the people who have
been working for the last two years to hammer out a Common Lisp
definition) are actually proposing.  I would like to clarify this before
too many people get too upset.

For a long time, Lisp has had EQUAL and EQ versions of some of the
important operators: MEMBER/MEMQ, DELETE/DELQ, etc.  Modern lisps have a
lot more data types and a lot more specialized equality predicates: EQL,
=, STRING=, etc.  Things began to multiply.  At one point, we had some
600 of these sequence functions, including such gems as RASS-EQL and
DEL-FROM-END-IF-NOT.  The decision was made to to cut this number down
by providing a small number of powerful generic functions that could be
further specialized by the use of keywords.  These generic functions
were uniformly given the "good" names.  Thus we have operators like
REPLACE, REMOVE, POSITION, and MEMBER, each of which takes a :TEST
keyword telling what sort of equality test to use.  In all cases, the
default test is EQL, by far the most useful.  (Though they are
redundant, we kept around MEMQ, DELQ, and ASSQ as historical monuments.)

So, if you want something that does what (MEMBER x y) does in Maclisp,
you have to say (MEMBER x y :TEST #'EQUAL) in Common Lisp.  We
considered many alternatives to this scheme: making EQUAL the universal
default, having MEMBER default to EQUAL while the other functions
default to EQL, or thinking up a new name for the function that does
what MEMBER does.  In the end, we decided to do what I described above.
It seemed clear to us that this would be best in the long run, after
everyone has forgotten the details of earlier Lisps, and it seemed like
an easy (mechanizable) conversion to put the :TEST 'EQUAL into every
MEMBER call in a file.

I'm sure that many people will disagree with this choice, but it was not
a frivolous or hasty decision; a lot of experienced Lisp implementors
agonized for a long time over this one, and finally reached an agreement
acceptable to all those participating in the Common Lisp design at that
time.  That is why we are reluctant to re-open the debate nine-months
later, only days before the Common Lisp manual goes to press.

I am now investigating ways to put all of the Common Lisp incompatibilities
into an optional mode which users could specify on a per-file basis.
This would allow users to convert only if they wish to.
I think I can arrange for nearly all incompatibilities to be
optional in this way.

    One of our 3600's (ROBOT1) keeps dropping dead (about once a day) with

    FEP> Machine halted "Wired-wait timeout, predicate ~S false for over
    ~D ms. ~@
    <211><211> Proceed to attempt recovery <DTP-6 20067> 72460(8)
    FEP>

Diagnosis:

  There are a large number of problems that all manifest themselves
  with this or a similar error message.  There are several software
  and microcode bugs; these are fixed in Release 5.  There are also
  at least two hardware bugs for which ECOs have been written.  These
  problems are all being worked on pretty vigorously.

Getting it fixed:

  It will probably take some time for the fixes to the sources of this
  problem to get to you.  As far as I know we have not decided to try to
  retrofit software fixes for this into Release 4; Release 5 should get to
  you some time in the fall.  You could contact field service to check
  on when they can install the hardware fixes; the phone number is
  576-2524 I think (you may want to check with Tom Callahan first).

Recovery:

  Normally you could type continue (at the FEP> prompt) and the
  machine would recover and continue the disk operation that timed
  out.  That's what the "proceed to attempt recovery" is trying to
  say.  Unfortunately this does not work because of a bug in the
  FEP software that bashes the state of the machine so that continuing
  doesn't work at all.

  In all cases that I have seen you can successfully recover from
  a wired-wait timeout by warm booting; type start <return> at
  the "FEP>" prompt.

Reports:

  If you feel like reporting this, please get more information, such
  as exactly what the machine was doing at the time.  You will probably
  find that it is impossible to get sufficiently precise information
  about which was going on, in which case we have to assume you are
  encountering one (or more) of the known causes of this symptom,
  not a new one that we don't know about yet.

There are two incompatible changes, part of Common Lisp,
that I warned users a year ago to watch out for.

These are (LISTP NIL) returning T,
and (// 5 2) returning the rational number 5\2 instead of 2.

I am now considering making these changes only for files
marked as being Common Lisp files, so that they will not affect
existing code.
This change of plans would mean less conversion work for you,
but it would produce a slightly less clean system.

I will leave the decision up to you, the users.  Please tell me your opinion.
Each of the two planned changes is a separate issue.


It would be desirable to treat the change to order of array elements
in the same fashion, but this is easier said than done.  Unless I
see a way to do it, I will have to make this change for all programs
as I announced a year ago.  See section 8.8 of the manual for details.

It seems that ZMail formerly did not put colons in front of symbols
such as SEND, FIRST and LAST in the ZMail init file
when they appeared as values of ZMail user options.
This did not matter in the past since SEND and :SEND were the same symbol.
But in system 97 they are different symbols.  :SEND, :FIRST, :LAST are
the symbols that are supposed to be there.  So ZMail init files should
be edited by hand to put colons in front of such symbols.

The init files thus edited will still work in system 94.

Certain Release 5.0 beta-test worlds at MIT have been contaminated in such
a way that the host MIT-MC thinks it has the name SCRC|DM.  This was caused
by a mistaken patch to the namespace server that has since been fixed.  But
since this bogus name never actually existed, as far as the namespace system
knew, the incremental update mechanism does not remove it.  The problem
has long since been fixed in the namespace server, LM15, but some worlds
exist that contain this incorrect information.

To correct this, load the file OZ:<MOON>FIX-MC.  You can load this in
your init file if you habitually use a world load with this problem.
The file is harmless if loaded into a machine that does not have the
problem.

If the file types out that it removed the bogus name, you can eliminate
the problem entirely by re-disk-saving any contaminated world: cold boot
it, (si:login-to-sys-host), load this file into it, and disk-save.  I
recommend that you DO NOT do this without checking with the person
primarily responsible for the machine in question, since some machines
seem to have their disks set up in particular ways that are halfway between
release 4 and release 5, and this should not be disturbed.

Sorry about the inconvenience to everyone's mail through MC.  This is the
sort of nasty lurking bug that beta-test is designed to expose.

Somebody, somehow in the last couple of days set ROBOT-3's chaos address
to be MOON's chaos address.  Who knows what they thought they were doing
or why.  Somebody also deleted the configuration.fep file which the
machine uses when it boots.

Needless to say, neither MOON nor ROBOT-3 worked very well when they
were both responding to the same network address.

Please refrain from exercising itchy fingers on things like network
addresses and boot command files.

Subject: High resolution video projection? 
To:   info-lispm%mit-oz@MIT-MC   

[I apologize to those who have already seen this msg; this is another attempt
to reach LISP machine users as opposed to people on Symbolics' internal mailing
lists]

I want to buy a hi-resolution monochrome video projector suitable for use with
generic LISP machine or Star-type terminals (ie approx 1000 x 1000 pixels).
It would be nice if it cost less than $15K and didn't require expensive 
replacement parts (like light valves).

Does anybody know of such currently on the market?

I know, chances seem dim, so on to my second point: I have heard it would be
possible to make a portable video projector that would cost $5K, weigh 25lb,
and project using monochrome green phosphor.  The problem is that industry
does not feel the market demand would justify production at such a price ...
Any ideas on how to find out the demand for such an item?  Of course if
all of you who might be interested in this kind of projector let me know
your suggestions, that would be a good start.
 
Thanks in advance for replies and/or notions,
Fred Lakin

  Because of the change from 24 to 25 bit pointers which occurred
with system 98, the kern tables of fonts saved in qfasl files in
previous systems contain incorrect values for use in system 98.
  The easiest way to transfer fonts from system 97 to 98 is to load
the font into a machine running system 97 and use fed to write out
a KST file for the font. Then load the KST file into system 98
(using fed) and write out the new qfasl file.
  All the fonts in the sys:fonts; directory have been updated, so
problems will only exist for user fonts.

Subject: Coming (System 99) changes to FORMAT in the MIT lisp machine system.
To: info-lispm-mit at MIT-OZ


[See SYS:DOC;SYS98 MSG (oz:ps:<l.doc>sys98.msg at MIT) to see this
message in a technicolor multitude of fonts.]

The control argument to FORMAT will change in System 99 to be compatible
with Common Lisp. There will no longer be separate functions FORMAT and
CLI:FORMAT, as there are in System 98.
This change will affect the following FORMAT directives:

~X      ~width,padchar,commacharX 
                Prints its argument in hexadecimal. (Analogous to ~O, ~B and ~D)
        This command used to be used to insert spaces into the output.

        Use ~numberofspaces@T to achieve the same result as the old
                ~numberofspacesX directive.

~F      ~width,decimalplaces,scale,overflowchar,padcharF
                Prints a floating-point number in nonexponential notation.
                Multiplies by 10^scale before printing if scale is specified.
                Prints in width positions, with decimalplaces digits after the
                decimal point.  Pads on left with padchar if necessary.  If the
                number doesn't fit in width positions, and overflowchar is
                specified, this command just fills the width positions with
                that character.
        This directive used to just take one optional prefix control arg, which
                specified how many mantissa digits to print. This is the same
                as 2 + decimalplaces for the new FORMAT.

        Use ~,n+2F to achieve the same result as the old ~nF directive.

~E      ~width,decimalplaces,exponentplaces,scale,overflowchar,padchar,exptcharE
                Prints a floating-point number in exponential notation.
                Prints in width positions, with exponentplaces digits of
                exponent.
                If scale (default is 1) is positive, prints scale digits before
                point, decimalplaces - scale + 1 after.
                If scale is zero, prints decimalplaces digits after the point,
                and a zero before if there's room.
                If scale is negative, prints decimalplaces digits after the
                point, of which the first -scale are zeros.
                If exptchar is specified, it is used to delimit the exponent
                (instead of "e" or whatever.)
                If overflowchar is specified, then if the number doesn't fit in
                the specified width, or if the exponent doesn't fit in
                exponentplaces positions, the field is filled with overflowchar
                instead.
        This directive used to just take one optional prefix control arg, which
                specified how many mantissa digits to print. This is the same
                as 2+decimalplaces for the new FORMAT.

        Use ~,n+2E to achieve the same result as the old ~nE directive.

~G      ~width,decimalplaces,exponentplaces,scale,overflowchar,padchar,exptcharG 
               Like ~E, but if the number fits without an exponent, it is
               printed without one.
        This command used to be used to go to a particular argument.

        Use ~argumentnumber@T to achieve the same result as the old
               ~argumentnumberG directive.

Note: in System 98 you must use CLI:FORMAT to use the new Common Lisp style format
directives. GLOBAL:FORMAT will continue to use the old directives.
In System 99 these two functions will become identical, so the best thing is to
update your code to use CLI:FORMAT now so that it will work in both System 98
and in future systems.

Since Brand S have also announced their intention to also change the meaning of
FORMAT directives to agree with Common Lisp at some time in the future, this will
also be compatible change in that respect.

All MIT lispms have a new instruction, CLI:FORMAT
(common-lisp-incompatible-format) Please update your code.

Subject: atan/atan2 -- possible changes.
To: info-lispm at MIT-OZ

Here's how things stand at the present:

There presently are two functions for taking arctangents,
"atan" and "atan2".

The difference between them is that atan returns a value
in the range 0 to 2*pi, whereas atan2 returns a value in
the range -pi to pi.
(ie  atan:(RxR)  [0,2]
    atan2:(RxR)  [-,])

atan is defined the way it is mainly for maclisp compatibility --
nearly everybody else in the computer languages world (*including
common lisp*) believes that a function called "atan" should return
what the lisp machine's atan2 returns.

So, the $64000 question is:
 Would anybody like to vote on whether the definition of atan
 should change to be what atan2 is now???

Such a change would not take place immediately, and in the meantime
the compiler could generate a warning saying to use atan2, whose
definition will not change.

Thanks.

If you don't read your mail on a LispM, you should know that the
ASCII char ^G has the same code as the LispM "pi" character and
ASCII char ^Y has the same code as the LispM "->" character.
MLY probably just forgot that some LispM users don't read their mail

A more up-to-date version of the Symbolics Release 5 Beta Test world
is available for 3600 users (with a CADR version to follow shortly).
A new microcode (tmc5-mic 270) should be installed in conjuction with
the new world.  To install the new microcode and world load:

 o   Clear out 20000. pages of space in your FEP file system, by deleting
     obsolete world loads, old scratch files, and such...

 o   Get the new microcode with (si:install-microcode 270.) assuming that
     OZ is up and happy.

 o   Get the new world from Buddy or Janis or whomever else has a copy,
     with (si:receive-band "buddy" "grape") [substitutions for "buddy"
     are encouraged to spread the load off that machine].  If the band
     transfer process offers to checksum the transfer, don't turn it
     down!  The checksum only takes an extra couple of minutes.

 o   Adjust whatever boot file was being used for booting Release 5.

Reboot the new world, and enjoy.

This new world has the following improvements over previous Release 5 worlds:
 Hardcopying to the dover works again (finally!).
 Boot time is shorter (about 1 minute).
 Miscellaneous bug fixes [(si:print-patches 'system 266.) tells all].

As in the past, we ask that any worlds customized from this standard world
be saved with a significantly different name.  It's a help to us when
a bug report says "Apiary Grape", "Grape MEF", "Moby GripeX", etc. as opposed
to the standard "Moby Grape".

Bugs to BUG-BETA-TEST@OZ, as usual.  Thanks.

Should TYPEP of one argument return a keyword (such as :SYMBOL)
or something in GLOBAL or USER (such as SYMBOL)?
The former is what it does now, and is more compatible with the
past few systems.  But it fails nowadays to be compatible with
Maclisp, which is what TYPEP of one argument is really supported for.
The latter would be compatible with Maclisp as it was originally
intended to be, but might break a few programs right now.

I've just configured a CADR Rel 5.0 Beta test rev 7 band
configured for MIT. So far as I know, know other configured bands
of this system exist.
Copy it from :
Cadr-4, LOD4    or
Cadr-9, LOD3  .

Its hard to figure out exactly how many blocks it needs.
It currently fits in 34000.
There is a bug in si:describe-partition where, if the 
actual number of blocks exceeds 32000, a garbage answer is printed
due to an overflow bug.

si:describe-partition claims the valid size of this band is
exactly 32000, which is hard to believe both because
its such a convienient number, and because I would have guessed
its actual size to be between 28k & 30k blocks.

The Release 5.0 world (with several namespace enhancements) is available
for 3600 users.  This world should cure the various boot-time problems common
to the Release 5.0 Beta Test worlds now in use on MIT 3600's.

With the availability of this world, the Release 5.0 product is no longer 
in beta test, hence bug reports should no longer be sent to BUG-BETA-TEST@OZ.
Instead, they should be sent to the appropriate list for the problem, be it
BUG-LISPM, BUG-ZWEI, BUG-ZMAIL, BUG-LMFS, or BUG-SYMBOLICS-HARDWARE.

Software questions (as opposed to bug reports) should be sent to HOSS@SCRC
(Home Office Software Support) or to Dennis Doughty, your Field Software
Support contact (doughty@SCRC).

The new world is available (via si:receive-band) as Release-5-0-plus.load
on the following machines:
 Aspen
 Buddy
 Elvis
 Jimi
 Janis
 Morrison
 
The world takes up 19763 blocks, and requires microcode 270 (the same 
microcode used in Release 5.0 Beta Test Rev 7).

A Release 5 world for CADR's should follow shortly.

        In APIARY-HARDWARE in Release 5.0, Experimental MIT 1.4, FEP 18, on APIARY-9 (3600):

        This keyboard seems to have some trouble:
                FUNCTION doesn't do its normal thing,
                Backslash sends Back-space,
                Backspace sends vertical bar,
                Backquote sends backslash,
        and probably other problems.

    This probably has something to do with all the new keytops we received.
    In that set, it looks like <function> and <local> have been swapped and
    other keys rearranged as you noticed.

You are quite correct; Release 5 assumes the new keytops are installed.

Rather than hunt around for documentation that never got to you, let me just
type in some paragraphs from a document entitled "Release 5 Update", dated
31 May 1984.

4.  Keytops:

    Release 5.0 requires a small change to the 3600 keyboard.  You should
find a small bag containing six keytops enclosed in your Release 5 software
package.  To install the keytops on your keyboard please do the following:

(1) Open up a paper clip so that one side forms a straight edge.

(2) Open up the package of keys.  Enclosed should be six keys with the
following symbols printed on them:

  FUNCTION   LOCAL   BACK   {   }   ~
                     SPACE  |   \   `

(3) Take the paper clip and pry up the FUNCTION key on the keyboard.  Replace
this key with the new function labelled LOCAL.

[Note that since none of the old keys are re-used in the new layout, you can
avoid confusion by setting the old keys well aside as you pry them up.]

 Sexuality and the Physician


\end{center}











      Physicians grow in confidence and competence through practice and
experience, medical students are taught again and again, but for that most
challenging confrontation, the first time, one cannot practice.  The only
softening of its blunt arrival comes from first plunging into one's
imagination, recognizing the situation that would, on its first time, shock
or unsettle, and exploring all the consequences one's feelings could create.
Those for which the average medical student is least prepared, even when
trained rigorously in medicine and ethics, Nancy Gagliano suggested as the
premise for tonight's meeting, are situations in which sexuality abruptly
bares itself in an otherwise sterile professional setting, in performing
one's first pelvic exam, for example, or extracting one's first sexual
history.

     For Nancy, the recognition of how unnerving the intrusion of sexuality
could be in a professional situation startled her.  She had spent the summer
doing library research for a neurologist at the Veteran Administration's 
Hospital, when he asked that she investigate the dentate ligament,
which runs between the corpora cavernosa of the penis.  Now she had not
only to read the literature, but also to dissect human specimens!
"I couldn't admit to the big, friendly man who ran the anaytomy lab
what I needed.  I stalled.  Finally I said, 'I need some specimens;'
and then I shrieked, 'some PENISES!'"

     In her future as a physician, Nancy wondered, how would she ever
be comfortable discussing intimate aspects of the body with her patients if
she
could not even say the word "penis" to an anatomist?  She acknowledged
that after seeing more patients, she would undoubtedly become more com-
fortable in the clinic with not only the vocabulary but also the entire
subject of sexuality but that it could only ease her trepidations to 
face them now. 

     Thus she ushered in the meeting's topic, "Sexuality and the Physician"
with a baring of her own apprehensions.  She hoped that by explicitly
introducing the multifaceted role sexuality plays in the daily practice
of medicine, she could incite the group to air similar anxieties and appre-
hensions, share attitudes and experiences and thereby educate and liberate
itself in a subject largely neglected in formal curriculums.  Her incite-
ment resulte in a discussion which ranged further than the issue of sexuality
into the fundamental aspects of the patient-physician relationship.  The
group confronted the barrier imposed by the roles that patient and physician
play and asked when it must be torn down in order to reach the underlying 
naturalness and sensitivity of ordinary humanity.

     Several articles the group had read helped to provide starting-points
for the discussion.  The first, by Julius Buchwald in                       
reported the beneficial results of a similar seminar in which students 
beginning ob-gyn rotations revealed emotional attitudes and reactions 
to performing the first pelvic examination.  Nancy summarized their
main fears: 1) of hurting the patient, 2) of being inept or being judged
inept, 3) of the patient or oneself getting sexaully aroused, and 4)of
finding the patient and/or the situation repulsive.  

     These concerns were in turn mirrored and elaborated on by the group as
they discussed intimate clinical examinations and situations.  Nancy
Gagliano wondered, "How will I walk in and do a genital exam on a young
attractive male?  I wouldn't be able to do it now without smiling and
blushing."  The patient would sense her embarrassment and lack of profession-
alism, and surely, she thought, she would only grow more self-conscious.
However, after her experiences this summer, she understood better what
was going on inside herself and perceived the problem as one of learning
to treat all bodies in a non-sexaul way, when she had been accustomed
to handling only certain male bodies in a sexual way.  It would be fascinating
to perform her first pelvic exam, yet at the same time awkward and disquieting
to touch a female patient.  The kay to overcoming her anxiety, she thought,
would be to be able to separate at will the human body from its sexuality.

     (               ) wondered why she did not share the worry some of her
friends expressed of becoming aroused while examining patients.  Was it
because her feelings on the subject were still in the "pluripotential
stage" and she had not yet reached a decisive attitude or because she
consciously blocked out her fears?  If the latter, then she worried what
would happen if she did get aroused by patients; her guilt would be
magnified by its unexpectedness.  "On the other hand," she said, "I do
worry that I might arouse my patient, by making a wrong move or being too 
tentative and schoolgirlish."

     (                     ) said that he had heard stories of male patients
getting erections under the examination of the more incompetent I.C.M.
students.  Allan Hobson doubted the report saying he'd never  known or heard
of a patient to get so aroused.  "As for myself," he continued, "I've
always been too nervous under the circumstances to feel anything sexual."

     Echoing Allan,  (                      ) said that her own performance
anxiety would be so high, she simply wouldn't be able to find the situation
erotic.  Steven Denlinger doubted for another reason that he could
be aroused in clinical situations.  "I have a history," he said,"of
decidedly not finding medical pictures of nudes erotic."

     "But what happens," countered (                ), "when the body is
living, breathing, warm, and standing in front of you?"

     Analyzing these concerns on another level, Clare Bloom admitted that
she had also worried how she would manage an aroused patient, but that she
had reognized a trick in hr thinking: as when she had first performed
venupuncture and nervously worried about her patient's nervousness,
now she felt she had projected her own anxiety about getting aroused onto
the patient.  "I can distill my nervousness, and not feel it, simply by
putting it onto someone else!"

     Worse for him than fears of sexuality, said (               ), was the
prospect of examining a "250-300 pound body.  It would revolt me, and yet I
would feel guilty for my disgust."  This concern struck a chord in the
group.  (                      ) said she dreaded above all the confrontation with
obesity, and (                    )
 confessed that he had been apalled in his third
year of medical school by the extent of human ugliness.  One unnamed student,
described by (             ), was so worried about seeing fat patients that
he planned to brave Boston's 'combat zone' for the first time to photo-
graph particularly fat nd ugly people in order to desensitize himself in 
preparation for the clinic.  Surely a patient with a personal history could
never be as offensive as such photographs, commented (                )!

     Until now the discussion had dealt with the problems of confronting
physical aspects of sexuality in a clinical setting, in switching from
a sexual to a clinical attitude when in intimate contact with another body.  
What might happen to us, though, asked(                        ), when we then 
switched back to the sexual setting?   Would the clinical sights and experi-
ences change our views of our personal seual lives?

     The answers must depend on what one's attitudes toward sex had been
before starting in the clinic, said (                   ).  If one's
sexual experiences had been overly objective and dijoint from the rest
of one's life, she continued, then, yes, the clinical view of sexuality
might be even more alienating.  But if one's sexuality were well-defined and
integrated in one's life, then surely it could sustain new comfrontations 
from the clinical realm.

     Clare Bloom extended the question, wondering whether "once we begin to
see living pathology in the whole body, will we be able to look at friends
and lovers in the same way as before?"  Allan Green answered that his 
colleagues and he, although not unaffected by thier clinical experiences,
had not changed so dramatically as to lose their nervousness or sensitivity
during delicate situations.  Their humanity had been preserved, he
concluded.

     Recalling her dissections of human penises, Nancy Gagliano said
that she'd had the distinct fear she would not be able to look at the
erect penis of her lover again without seeing the erect penis of a
cadaver.  Although she did have flashbacks occasionally,she said, more
importantly, she felt more comfortable with genitals as a result of
her work.  Simply by becoming more familiar with the anatomy of
sexuality, she could better view genitals as parts of a whole rather
than as parts separate in themselves.  Several others agreed on the
beneficial effects of such familiarity and knowledge   

     Allan Hobson proposed that although it would seem that in switching 
between settings, one might get one's wires crossed, the context wielded
a remarkable power to keep them straight.  "The context explains why
I'm in no way aroused in clinical/pathological settings, and yet, having
seen all sorts of pathology, I'm in no way impaired in non-clinical 
settings."
      
      The patients too are not simply passive objects in the clinical 
situation but contribute to its dynamics with their own feelings and 
attitudes.  The burden of one's role as a physician is lifted not only
by closely examining one's feelings, but also by shifting to the patient's
point of view.  Two articles the group read illustrated this shift.  In
"The Pelvic Examination: A View From the Other End of the Table,"  Joni 
Magee suggests ways to make the pelvic exam less unpleasant for the
patient, base on her experiences both as a patient and gynecologist.
Implicit in her article is the urge to focus on the patient's feelings 
as if they were one's own; one can thus displace one's discomfort in
a healthy way and gain new insight into the situation.  

     Along similar lines, Judith Mitchell in "Male Adolescents' Concern
About a Physical Exam Conducted By a Female" present findings that the
average male adolescent is afraid of a female examiner touching him; afraid
specifically of her touching his genitls; afraid of her not taking his
word on his health; and, most of all, "afraid of what the other guys would
think" to know he had been examined by a female.  She argues that these
concerns should be honored in such examinations with careful consideration.
Nancy remarked that the article was important also for illuminating the fact
that although "men may have a corner on the market" in examining the opposite
sex, one must consider equally the difficulties and concerns that arise when
female physicians examine men.

     Other articles that Nancy summarized dealt with more subtle
attitudes affecting the interaction between patient and physician.
The first, by (                     ), reported a bias amongst patients
towards the physician's gender.  All patients, male or female, were
more likely to choose a male over a female g.p., but males were much
less likely than females to choose a female g.p., so that female g.p.s
had a patient population 70% female, 30% male, whereas male g.p.s had
one 50% female, 50% male.

     Another study reported a correlation between the attractiveness of the
physician and the openness of the patient in reporting his symptoms. 
Generally, a patient gave more information to a doctor of the same sex, but,
on the whole, patients told most to a highly attractive male doctor.  
Members of the seminar raised objections, however, to the method of the
study, in which a subject looked at pictures of physicians that had been
rated on physical attractiveness and chose those to whom he would most likely
tell his problems.  Allan Green said that attractiveness in the actual
presence of the physician might be measured in terms different from
physical qualities, such as ability to listen or to make the patient feel at
ease; furthermore, his own observations of successful physicians didn't
concur with the results.  (                     ) also pointed out
that the concept of attractiveness varied widely; how could the pictures be
accurately rated when males may equate it with strength and power, while
females may view attractiveness as something completely different?  Nancy
agreed that the study ignored the live patient-physician interaction,
and, harking back to the earlier discussion, Alan Green commented that
the interaction might even change significantly if the physician was so
attractive as to actually arouse the patient.

     Yet if the results were to be accepted, how might they be interpreted,
asked (                     )?  Did they mean that attractive male doctors were
trusted more than female ones?  Steven Denlinger wondered if the phenomenon
might not be similar to what happens at a cocktail party, when one tries
to seek out and hold the attention of the person he finds most attractive;
the patient may have similar desires and fantasies in trying to describe 
his problems so well that he elicits the physician's personal interest
in response.   Nancy commented that the bias may simply reflect the fact that
there are more male than female physicians; the males therefore have more
patients and the females haven't yet been fully accepted or treated equally
by society.

     In a similar study that Nancy reported, the physician's bias towards
the patient's gender was revealed.  Physicians were three times more 
likely to describe a female's complaint - illustrated in a vignette -
as psychosomatic than a male's, and more likely to prescribe sedatives 
to her than to him.  On the other hand, physicians tended to deny the
emotional aspects of a male's complaint and instead to treat it as purely
physical, further denying the less open male patient of emotional and
psychological support.  

    In light of these statistics, (                        )'s anecdote
was particularly interesting.  She once worked under a very tough, machismo
ex-Marine policeman, who, hearing of her plans for medical school, said
he would 'love to go to a female doctor,' that he couldn't tolerate a 
male touching his body.  Perhaps, (                ) wondered, when
"push came to shove," he might have preferred the traditional male, but she
felt there was truth in his desire: many men find themselves physically
more comfortable and emotionally more intimate with women and this ease
may extend to the clinic.

     Nancy then introduced another aspect of the patient-physician
relationship.  Delicate clinical examinations normally arouse fears and
discomforts, she said, yet they have the potential also to evolve into
abusive situations, in which feelings on both sides may change radically.
Where is the line drawn, and how do the attitudes of patients and
physicians change when abuse threatens?

      [Insert]

  (                 ) told a simialr story of a gynecologist who
"put his patients on the table and instead of a speculum inserted his
penis."  His patients, generally of a low socio-economic class, although
certainly aware that his behavior was abnormal, had never accused him,
and he had been neither arrested nor prosecuted.

     Allan Hobson remarked that these silent patients were most likely 
intimidated by the medical context, in which they played an ignorant,
supplicant role, and dared not question the physician's procedure.  Some 
certainly blamed themselves for the incomprehensible occurrence of sex.
Nancy added that some patients, should they have had the courage, might not
have known what they could do to defend themselves.

     The question then arose of how physicians with such potential to 
abuse patients were allowed into the profession.  (             )
related an experience he had as a third year medical student on a gynecology
rotation.  A senior resident who was generally believed to have a sexual
problem one morning made a revealingly crude comment about his activities
with female patients.  On another occasion when (               )'s female
partner asked if she could do anything to help in the O.R., the resident
replied , "Yeah, take off all your clothes."  When his behaviour later
came up in conversation, he admitted to (                   ) that he had a
problem, but that he had gone into gynecology specifically to "resolve
it," by exposure.  Allan Hobson remarked that screening should, but clearly
didn't, eliminate that type of problem-solving.

     Nancy wondered if it were true that the incidence of such sexual abuse 
were highest among gynecologists and psychiatrists.  Alan Green replied,
yes, they, of all physicians, have the most intimate contact with patients."
He asked the group to consider, however, is it were ever appropriate for 
a physician to have a sexual relationship with a patient to whom he is 
attracted, whether inside or outside the medical context.  (            )
thought that in any therapeutic setting, whether psychological or physical,
the professional relationship precluded a more personal one, and if the
boundary were crossed, the patient should post-haste be referred to another
physician.  The conclusion voiced by Alan Green was that in no circumstance
could such an intimate relationship be justified; the patient, whether
a woman in stirrups or a man in a blood-pressure cuff, is in an "extremely 
vulnerable position" and the physician must recognize his power and not take
advantage of it.  Even when affairs or marriages between patient and physician
occur long after treatment has ended, they cannot be condoned.


     Having highlighted these tensions involved in delicate clinical situa-
tions, the group then turned to weays of ameliorating them.  Nancy Gagliano
began by considering how one simply talked about sexualtiy with a patient.
Taking a sexual history is in itself a delicate procedure and Nancy 
illustrated the point by contrasting two questionnaires; the first, taken
from a counselor's examination, included questions such as : "What are
{your} individual needs for optimal sexual functioning?," "How do {you
and your partner} communicate about sexual issues?," "what is {your}
masturbatory behaviour?", and "how do {you} meet {your} needs for intimacy?"
while the second, from a dermatology exam, asked, "how frequently per
month {do you have} intercourse?,"how frequently do you masturbate?" and
"how is {your partner's} sexual functioning?"  Because dermatology deals
with a patient's skin and hence his appearance, which very much influences
his sexuality, and the article from which the latter questions were taken
purported to teach its readers how to take a sexual history, Nancy found
"appalling" the manner in which the patients were attacked by demands
for "numbers of times" rather than treated as individuals with needs as
the first questionnaire did.  She described an incident she had witnessed
in the operating room where a male patient required urgent shortening
of the tunica albuginea to relieve torsion of the testes.  The patient
requested very neat stitches as he was a striptease dancer and "jokes
flew around the room, where everyone else but the attendant was female."
The resident surgeon after unsuccessfully quizzing the patient asked the
attendant what the odd mark was on the patient's penis and was told
"a human bite, of course." Turning to the patient, she asked, "How
did you get that on your penis?' and he replied, 'Dear, you don't ask
"what's that," you ask, "who bit you?"'  The important thing in talking about
the patient's sexual history, Nancy concluded, was not to reveal one's
bias or judgment, but rather to be bold and to provoke an open discussion.


     (                 )pointed out that although that guideline worked in
dealing with experienced but closed patients, igt might not work, for
example, with inexperienced adolescents.  "If one followed Mitchell's 
instructions and asked, 'when did you first masturbate?' of a young boy
who hadn't yet masturbated, he might feel humiliated, afraid or forced to 
lie."  It was difficult in some situations,(               ) suggested,
to know whether to be bold or tentative.  

     (                )a greed and said that over the summer a similar 
question had arisen with young male diabetics.  It's a fact that male 
diabetics become impotent as the disease progresses, so when does one 
break it to a severely afflicted young patient?  A 15-year-old struggling
with the normal throes of adolescence and with diabetes in addition, 
probably would not be able to handle the knowledge. Yet the 'rule' of
'5 years after the onset of the disease' seems simple enough in the
classroom.(              ) suggested that one ought certainly to get an
idea of the patient's sexual life first before broaching the subject
of impotence, but that the problem remained of how to discuss sex with
a young patient.  Should one wait until the patient brought up the 
subject?  Steven Denlinger commented, "If I were to lose erectile func-
tion in a few years, I'd certainly want to know about it as soon as
possible."(                   ) added that it one said nothing, in
the case of a well-documented disease like diabetes, the patient would
most likely read or hear about the facts elsewhere, but noted that 
"he may not come back to discuss them with you, but instead just get
depressed."  Alan Green suggested that it was the physician's obligation
to give the patient the possible outcomes whether or not he might learn 
elsewhere, but Allan Hobson qualified the remark saying there could be
no absolute rule -- one could never, categorically, tell each patient all
aspects of his disease and prognosis; :some patients want to know, others
make it clear they do not want to know, and some you know would over-
react in terror at the bad news."  The same problem also occurs in
choosing when to tell a patient he has a terminal illness. "My guideline,
in part, " Allan said, "is to move as far as I can before encountering
defensive or phobic anxiety."


     Much of the art of medicine is in learning when to say what, agreed
Alan Green.  As another example, he raised the problem of giving a prognosis
to a patient with multiple sclerosis, a disease which varies widely in its
progression.  A patient may experience two or three isolated bouts in a
lifetime or he may be confined to a wheel chair within three years of the
diagnosis. "Should one give him hope by giving only the first prognosis, or
should one explain the whole continuum of possibilities?"

     In reply(                        )
 reiterated Allan Hobson's point, saying 
that what one told a patient must depend on his particular history, both
inside and out of the medical relationship.  He related a personal story.
"I once had a psychiatric patient who developed neurological symptons
and was hospitalized while I was away.  When I returned, I was faced with
chossing the best method to break the news of a multiple sclerosis diagnosis
to him.  I conferred with the neurologist and we both agreed that it was his 
duty to deliver the diagnosis, but only if I could join my patient immediately
afterwards to assess his reaction and offer him support."  The patient closed
his ears to the worst in his prognosis and confided to Steve that he was
afraid to go out into the world after having battled a psychiatric illness for
15 years, only to be struck down by a physical one.  He would rather never 
recover from his psychiatric illness, he said.  On the other hand, his family,
who were involved in the ongoing psychotherapy, wanted to know specific 
answers, to know all possible outcomes.  In dealing with the neurologist, the
patient, and the patient's family, with their different levels of attitudes
and authority, (                   ) had to make difficult decisions for which 
there were no hard and fast rules, only feelings to play by.

     Steven Denlinger marveled at the seeming smoothness of (              )'s
experience in pooling resources to cope with the patient's crisis.  "When I 
worked in the cardiac unit at the Brigham," he said,"I was required to trans-
cribe verbatim my interviews with patients and then to discuss them line-
by-line with my supervisor, to decide whether I had said the right thing at
the right time."  In other specialties and at higher levels, did such instruc-
tive scrutiny of one's techniques take place? 

     In one's residency,(                   ) replied, such scrutiny did
take place, but later, one simply had to learn by experience.  One must
accept one's mistakes and like a comedian who makes a bad joke know how to turn
bad to good and when not to repeat oneself.

     "Such comfort as I've developed," emphasized Allan Hobson,"has come from
patients, not other doctors.  They show you how far to go, if you try to
keep in touch with your own feelings -- a difficult task since M.D.s are not
supposed to have feelings.  Patients themselves are not as fragile as we
think; they have their own resources, and they might some burdens easier
than we do?"

     The remarkable but simple thought that the patients might not simply be
helpless subjects but rather helpful colleagues took hold and cheered the
group.  Some recalled illustrative instances: Once (                  ) worked 
as an orderly at the bottom of the hierarchy in a hospital, performing tasks
considered unpleasant or improper for female staff. , one of which was
euphemistically called "to finish a bath."  He would wash the genitalita of
bedridden men after the female nurses had bathed their other parts.  Once while
doing so for a young quadriplagic, he was embarrassed to see his patient's
penis erect.  Immediately however, the young man perceived (             )'s
feelings and said "don't worry about that; it happens all the time."

     Another time he gave an enema to an elderly man who was ready and
anxious to leave the hospital.  He could detect (              )'s discomfort 
and being both patient and religious, began to pray audibly not only for
himself, but also for (                )).  "I suspect that a lot of
patients we'll work with will be veteran," concluded (                 ),"and
will be willing to give of their experience and knowledge."

     Steven Denlinger recalled a similar example from an article on medical
ethics by Steve Hoffman in the Alumni Bulletin a few years ago.  The author
described learning arterial punctures on an elderly woman, unsuccessfully 
jabbing her arm again and again.  She responded by shouting to a passing 
attendant, 'This medical student really knows his stuff,' because  in prac-
ticing on her, he had made her feel a comrade in his learning and healing.

     The discussion had gradually come to pinpoint the conventional roles
of physician and patient as much of the source of unease in delicate
clinical situations.  In fact, the group realized,a  simple way to deal with
tensions or fears was to loosen the physician's garb when it became too
restrictive, and to reveal the underlying human engagement.  Using one's
feelings as guides rather than repressing them was often the way to the
most humane, therapeutic solution in a difficult clinical problem, Allan 
Hobson had said.  Yet the roles must also be maintained enough to impose
responsibility and control, the group concluded in the remainder of the
discussion.

     (                      drew on the new sense of sensitivity and relief by
asking whether it was acceptable to simply admit one's feelings, such as
to say:"I'm a bit new at this -- my hands may be a bit cold."  Steven 
Denlinger echoed her, saying he'd thought about that question for the last two
years.

     Allan Hobson encouraged the students to do so; "no matter how much exper-
ience one has," he said,"one should never expect to be perfectly confident.
When, in certain situations, I am forced to make a tentative approach to a
patient's problem, I always begin by confessing, 'I'm not certain this is
correct...' and only then offer my opinion."

     But(                  )    raised the possibility that in some delicate
examinations, for example, a pelvic, one's admission of inexpertise might
instead make the patient more uncomfortable.

      Allan replied that there was a difference in being comfortable or
uncomfortable about one's own discomfort.  "If I accept my discomfort in a
normal situation and state it without spreading anxiety and panic, and
instead elicit my patient's alliance and cooperation, then I make him 
feel better.  If I spill out my anxiety, without having thought it through, 
then I make him feel worse."

     It wasn't always so easy to admit one was still a student and not yet
fully qualified, said Clare Bloom.  Often when accompanying a clinical tutor
she would be introduced to a patient as 'Dr. Bloom.' a title she would then
be forced to challenge if she wished to alleviate her inexpertise by
explaining that she was not a doctor, and in fact, learning from the
patient himself.

     Steven Denlinger commented that in the previous years some of the I.C.M.
students had been angered by just such authority from the attending physicians;
particukarky when after having been touted as doctors, the students might
worry they wouldn't know an 'ear from an elbow' on the physical exam.  They
had suggested that students be given a unique and distinctive garb for 
immediate identification in the hospital.  A variety of eager suggestions arose
from the group.

     Many patients, said (                   ), would easily recognize medical
students simply by their behaviour and attitudes.  She related her story of 
working in a hospital where she did not perform physical examinations on 
patients but discussed with them details of theor personal lives such as
impotence caused by illness.  Sometimes she would feel compelled to remind 
patients that she was only a medical student and they would usually reply, "Oh,
I know, that's the only reason I was talking to you."

     "What do you think that meant?" asked Allan Hobson.

     "That they were hostile to doctors," replied (                  ).

     She further explained that because she was there to learn how people
cope with illness, she had more time to spend with them, and never imposed
a schedule on them.  They undoubtedly felt freer and more willing to open
up to her and help her.

     Alan Green agreed that as a student one has a very special relationship
with the patient.  "As a student, you aren't ultimately responsible for the
care of someone's illness and therefore his attitude toward you will be 
different, more tolerant, understanding, and sympathetic than toward his
doctor."

     If, on the contrary, the patient's attitude were obnoxious or offensive,
there would be nothing wrong in confronting him, concluded the group.  
(                     ) confessed that a "tough guy" making rude comments
would unnerve her more than a patient with an erection.   Allan Hobson said
that in this new situation there were again no absolute rules on how to
handle it, but that one had to be sensitive to the motivation between the
patient's behaviour.  Alan Green said, "If you're a psychotherapist, talk
about it."  Nancy emphasized that one oughtn't feel there is such "holiness"
about the examination room that one couldn't say straight to the patient, 
when the situation has gone too far,"Either you cooperate, or I won't be able 
to help you."


      "Not all medical students belong to William James Seminars; where do
most learn what we've taught ourselves tonight?" asked (                   )
Nancy related an experience, again from her summer's work, which revealed that
some doctors never learn.  She observed a physician performing the Doppler
technique on an elderely man to determine the patency of the dorsal arteries
and veins of his penis.  After half an hour of the operation, the patient,
very upset, asked what was wrong and the physician merely shrugged him off.
Nancy interpreted his inability to discuss sexual dysfunction with the patient
as an unwillingness to venture into an area where he knew little, but she
emphasized that even without all the answers, a doctor must know how to deal
with a patient's fears.

     Is the necessary emotional and sexual education ever taught in a formal
curriculum?  Students mentioned courses in sexual dysfunction, human
reproductive pathophysiology, and human sexuality, which dealt largely
with the physical aspects of sexuality.  In  the introductory psychiatry
course, however, Alan Green said psychological aspects such as the demystifi-
cation of the doctor's task in treating sexual problems were probed and
 afilm of several downright funny but appalling scenes between doctors and
patients was used to illustrate the points madein lecture.

    (                )  described the reaction his class in the second year
of medical shool had had to an explicit film on homosexuality: silence. 
The instructors abruptly ended the class, the last of the course, and
departed.  During the film it was clear that some strong emotional responses
had been elicited from the audience but afterwards there was no discussion 
whatsoever.

    (                 )'s story prompted (              ) to describe the most
popular course in his undergraduate school, which explored human sexuality
through films and discussions.  "The small discussion groups saved the course,"
said (                      ) "I compare my medical school education with what
I learned then, which gave me much better education in sexuality and I feel
for those people who don't get it here."

     "Society in general expects us to be much better trained in sexuality
than we are," nancy said.  "Society expects us to be the ones who are
knowledgable and comfortable and who take the initiative.  We cannot wait
for the patients to become so uncomfortable that they must confront the 
issue."  Her words again pointed to the role that physicians are expected
to play, but here to its necessary and beneficial aspects.  A physician
who does not live up to the responsibility of his role can experience
no relief in playing it down, only failure.

     Two reactions from the group summarized the conclusions that had been 
steadily illuminated.  (                ) said that the acceptance of
his role as physician had come to him as a revelation; that it gave him 
strength and made the responsibility it required him to shoulder seem reasonable and bearable.  Yet at the same time, he knew that he should always fall
back on his feelings as the best guide to what was happening.

     The feeling of the group towards the concerns they had expressed was 
reflected in (              ) 's exclamation, "I feel better, just
having talked about them."

Subject: New Symbolics world load for 3600s
To: Info-Lispm-MIT at MIT-OZ

There is a new and improved Symbolics world load availiable to MIT.  The
name of the load is Release-5-2-prime.load, and it is available on any
one of these machines for band transferring to your machine: SID, ELVIS,
JIMI, MOON, BUDDY, DUANE, JANIS, MORRISON, ROBOT-1, ROBOT-4, APIARY-6,
APIARY-5, ASPEN, ZERMATT. It is highly recommended that if you are
currently using a 5.2 load, you start using this load as soon as
possible.

The changes to this world load significantly improve the performance of
the Namespace system. Patches were added to query servers only at the
local site and solve the MC/DM problem. Perhaps most importantly, with
this new load, MIT is now running a 3600 as a primary namespace server.
The machine's name is REAGAN. CADR-15 has been permanently
decommissioned as a namespace server.

Subject: Re:  New Symbolics world load for 3600s (bug)

It seems that the world load has lm15 listed as a secondary to MIT
which is incorrect.  It is best to correct that fact before resaving the
world.

This is a problem I have noticed with the scrc namespace.  The problem
can be observed by using the function (query-namespace ...) defined in
tweety:>util>query-namespace.(lisp/bin).  This uses the function
(neti:query-namespace-server class namespace properties) to find out
current information about objects.  It prints whether the information
was found on the server, whether the server considered it valid, and
whether the information was found locally using find-object-named.

It has usually been the case that when the primary was down, queries
about objects in some namespace went out to secondaries of that
namespace and came back "present but invalid" since the secondary
couldn't verify the requested information.  However, on some occasions
the server claimed that the information was present and valid even
though it was out of date.

This is what happened to me with the scrc namespace as seen from the scrc
namespace with a query from daffy to ap6.  Apparently, ap6 was out of
contact with scrc.  From daffy I asked for namespace scrc in namespace
scrc via the following request:
(query-namespace :namespace "scrc" :scrc)
This came back valid and present, but showed lm15 as a secondary.

I telneted to ap6 and tried the same query.  From there it came back
invalid and present.  So ap6 knew the info was out of date and claimed
that it was valid anyway!!  I then reset-host-availabilities on ap6,
redid the query and got valid information.  Then tried the same back on
daffy and got valid information.  The important fact was that daffy had
know way of being sure that ap6 hadn't lied!  Only if you were using ap6
itself could you tell that the info was invalid.

To make a long story short I have the following suggestion for
maintainers of secondaries.  In the file query-namespace.bin is another
function (validate-namespace) that resets all host availabilities and
then tries lots of queries for important things like namespaces and
networks and primaries and secondaries (and some unimportant things like
:user dove).  Please load this function and see that it evaluates
completely before saving worlds on secondaries!  This will save the rest
of us undue grief.

    This bug is easily reproduced; just type <function> <help>.  However
    it seems to be deeply rooted, as the same error crops up if you then try
    to send a bug report, either from the debugger or from ZMail.  That's
    why this message isn't in the form of a bug report.

    I think something is finding a string where it expects a flavor object. 
    Error messages look something like:

	...

The bug is in your init file.
    (login-setq
	...
	    zwei:*host-for-bug-reports* "OZ"	  ; Where to BUG- people.
	)
zwei:*host-for-bug-reports* is supposed to be a host, not a string.
Many other people have reported this, but apparently our replies haven't
hit everybody.  Therefore, I am sending this to LispM-Uses.

This applies for Symbolics machines running 5.2.
zwei:*host-for-bug-reports* must be a host object, not a string.  If you
don't like the default value (I don't know what it is) and if you want
it to be OZ, you should use (net:parse-host "OZ") instead of just the
string "OZ".  Everybody please update your init files.

In the next few days we will be soon running a beta test version of

that cause them to die sometimes when querying release 6 namespace
servers. A patch exists to fix this bug, and a newly patched world load

many 7th floor machines (ELVIS, JIMI, JANIS, BUDDY, MOON, ROBOT1). You
should put this world load on your machine today, and avoid problems
tomorrow. If you want to patch an existing world load to avoid this bug,
load "sys: patch; name6" and disk save the world.
