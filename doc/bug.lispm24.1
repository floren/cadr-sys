Subject: Don't mode me in!  Error handler and input editor conflict

I am forever typing C-C to the error handler, expecting to see my
previous input expression appear, and instead invoking the <Resume>
proceed option.

This is of course a special case of the problem that these two systems
use many identical Control and Meta commands, conditioned by "error
handler mode".  The visual indication that error handler mode is
active -- a right-pointing arrow -- is unfortunately not sufficient to
prevent me from typing C-C to the wrong program.

It's not half as bad as it might be, since few of the input-editor
commands are very meaningful when there is not yet any input to edit.
So it might be sufficient simply to redefine C-C in the error handler
to say "Eval:" and pass the C-C along to the input editor.  This
certainly doesn't seem like a loss, since there are two other commands
one can type to invoke that proceed option, one of which is on a nice
big fat double-wide <Resume> key!

I don't understand why nobody else has complained about this.  Doesn't
anyone else evaluate forms in the error handler?  Is there some trick
I've missed?

Subject: Symbolics REL 5.1 at MIT + PIG is now the sys host for MIT


I have made a World load with the Symbolics Release 5.1 patches in it.
It's name is Release-5-1-plus.load.1,
and can be found on at least the following lisp machines:

	elvis
	buddy
	jimi
	morrison

Rel 5.1 requires version 292 of the microcode, so snarf that too.
Update your Lisp machine today!

With this new release, the sys host has been moved from OZ to PIG.
The most important thing to remember about this fact is that the MIT
site directory is now PIG:USRD$:[S.R5.SITE], instead of
OZ:OZ:<S.R5.SITE>.

    Goldy is a 3600 with 3 eagles.  Occasionally I have noticed that it
    will get into a state where it does not boot because of a disk
    mounting problem which shows up as follows:

Is this very shortly after powering on the machine, or does it happen
with rebooting as well?

    CLEAR SCREEN    works
    CLEAR MACHINE   works
    MOUNT 0
    MOUNT 1  occasionally bombs
    MOUNT 2  bombs

    The problem is that the FEP claims the disk is not ready, and then
    aborts the boot file.  Once Goldy gets into this state, it stays in
    it.  Halting the FEP and letting the disks spin down and then back up
    fixes it.
This sounds like one of the standard robustness problems with the FEP
that has a good chance of getting fixed in the new FEP system.
    Doing the mounts by hand works fine, but in the process of
    starting up lisp, when the file system is booting itself, you'll get
    thrown into the FEP. This has happenned to me twice, and I think to
    another person once, and it is not common.  
Can you give any more details.  Why does it go into the FEP?
    The FEP version is 18.
That shouldn't cause a problem.

    Tonight when it happenned, I had just done a
    (si:full-gc :system-release t)
    followed by a disk save, which I let update the boot file for
    me and I vaguely recall maybe having done something like that the
    other time, but can't say for sure, there having been environmental
    reasons for any kinds of wierdness the other times.  Has this been
    noticed on any other multi-eagle systems?
If it has happened on Quabbin (4 eagles, I think) I haven't been told.

Eventually.  c-C and m-C are being phased out.  In the meantime, just
retrain your fingers to type c-m-Y rather than c-C and m-Y instead of
m-C.  It seems to work in all contexts where c-C works, and doesn't
cause any conflicts.  (See the New Yank System document or whatever it's
called.)

	    The 3600 window system provides a range of drawing functions,
    e.g. draw-line, draw-curve, draw-wide-curve, that will draw things on
    windows.  However, at least according to the documentation, only a
    small number of these functions have analogs for drawing things onto
    arrays.  Since I wanted to be able to draw curved objects in arrays
    and then bitblt them to a window, I had to copy the code for
    draw-curve and draw-wide-curve and produce slightly modified versions
    that would draw to arrays.  This was not difficult to do, but it did
    not seem like the type of thing I should be having to do.  

A more modular way to do this is to make a dummy window to draw on that 
has a bit save array.  You can bitblt (by sending :bitblt msgs to the window)
the results from the save array to your array.

As far as I know this usually means that the DP board does not contain the ECO
that I issued in April 1983.  Does field service think the DP board is up to
the Release 5 ECO level?  Does this error happen whenever the GC is invoked
on Jimi?

Well foo, c-C is a lot easier to type than c-m-Y.  But I see the point
about consistency with Zmacs.

Actually, what would have been the right thing from the beginning is
for mouse-left or mouse-middle to have popped up a history menu from
which an entry could be selected for editing.  Not to mention that
mouse-left should move point, and matching parens should blink...
C'mon worms, get back in the can...

The shortly after powering up problem has a different set of
difficulties, and they're temporary (that's what the mounts are for).

Goldy had been powered up for several days at least, I think about 5
days since the previous boot.  I'm still trying to get information on
it, and I'll try forcing it to boot next time and then use v18-debug on
it.  I didn't have it the last time.

You know, it may have lisp stopped itself because part of the paging
area is on disk 2 and part on 0, and if there were problems getting to
2, that would break things.  I imagine a full GC would make it into the
paging area on Disk 2, and maybe that has something to do with it.
Maybe not too.  I'll send any more news I find out about it.

of Encyclopaedia Symbolica should say that the :NO-SELECT option must appear
BEFORE the :VALUE option if it is to work [or change it if you want it 
order-independent].

(TV:MENU-CHOOSE '(("Don't select me"  :NO-SELECT T :VALUE DONT-SELECT)
                  ("Select me" :VALUE SELECT)))

works, but 

(TV:MENU-CHOOSE '(("Don't select me" :VALUE DONT-SELECT :NO-SELECT T)
                  ("Select me" :VALUE SELECT)))

doesn't.

You didn't really want two errors, did you?  Wouldn't it be better for
the Resume to the first error (which was labelled Create RUP with
default characteristics) to ask you whether it should use the package
that had been defined in the meantime?  I'm assuming that you loaded the
package definition to the error prompt and didn't notice that Resume was
create and not try to find again, right?

		The 3600 window system provides a range of drawing functions,
	e.g. draw-line, draw-curve, draw-wide-curve, that will draw things on
	windows.  However, at least according to the documentation, only a
	small number of these functions have analogs for drawing things onto
	arrays.  Since I wanted to be able to draw curved objects in arrays
	and then bitblt them to a window, I had to copy the code for
	draw-curve and draw-wide-curve and produce slightly modified versions
	that would draw to arrays.  This was not difficult to do, but it did
	not seem like the type of thing I should be having to do.  

    A more modular way to do this is to make a dummy window to draw on that 
    has a bit save array.  You can bitblt (by sending :bitblt msgs to the window)
    the results from the save array to your array.
Although this technique is even recommended in the Window System examples
(it is the only way to do this), it is clearly wrong, and all the graphics
drawing frobs should use subroutines (if possible, duplicate if not), for
drawing on arrays.

The new message-passing system (send it to the array or window identically)
would not be bad either....

    The shortly after powering up problem has a different set of
    difficulties, and they're temporary (that's what the mounts are for).
Well, it's actually to tell the FEP about the disks so it can tell Lisp
at "some appropriate time".  Therefore, you need to MOUNT everytime the
FEP is reset, which is why they are in boot files.

    Goldy had been powered up for several days at least, I think about 5
    days since the previous boot.  I'm still trying to get information
    on it, and I'll try forcing it to boot next time and then use
    v18-debug on it.  I didn't have it the last time.

    You know, it may have lisp stopped itself because part of the paging
    area is on disk 2 and part on 0, and if there were problems getting to
    2, that would break things.  I imagine a full GC would make it into the
    paging area on Disk 2, and maybe that has something to do with it.
    Maybe not too.  I'll send any more news I find out about it.
So maybe disk 2 is flakey in general, e.g., a hardware problem?

Subject: C-X J
To: BUG-LISPM at MIT-OZ

In System 98.67, CADR 3.8, ZMail 53.18, MIT-Specific 22.2, microcode 309,
gc@36, on Lisp Machine Two:


Insert your description of the circumstances here:

In a freshly booted system 98.67, I created two buffers, FOO and BAR:

C-X B FOO Return Return
Typed a few lines of text.
C-X B BAR Return Return
Typed a few lines of text.

C-X S J  to save point in buffer BAR.
C-M-L to switch back to buffer FOO.
C-X J J  to jump to point saved in buffer BAR -- it selects and starts
the redisplay ok, but then gets this error.

I have been suspicious of this before, in that I have on occasion found
ZWEI having two different buffers point to the same text.  E.g., I'd
find myself with buffer ONE displaying the same text as buffer TWO,
although they displayed different mode line info.  (Different names,
different modified-p, and even had different points.)  However, I have
not been able to get any scenario to reproduce that situation.  It has
happened when I've been using C-X J/S, though, so I'm hoping this will
fix both problems.

Subject:  Bad interactions between mouse blinkers in ZWEI
To: BUG-LISPM @ MIT-MC

In Symbolics Release 4.5 on OU Lisp Machine Alan Turing:

If you do m-. and then bury the Zmacs window before typing anything,
then all ZWEI windows (not just Zmacs windows) get the little up-arrow
mouse cursor and the hollow box blinker around function names.

Also, conversely, if you try to use this blinker mechanism for tracking
other kinds of things in other ZWEI windows, you find that it intrudes
on the Zmacs mouse blinker.

It would be nice if a mechanism were provided for pointing to things in
arbitrary ZWEI windows according to a user-defined interestingness predicate.
It looks like most of the mechanism is already there for this, but just
badly structured for any other purpose than m-.

cc: ZVONA @ MIT-MC

In Symbolics Release 4.5 on OU Lisp Machine Alan Turing:

There should be a general utility for specifying whether a given range
of text in ZWEI can be deleted (by ZWEI:DELETE-INTERVAL).

For example, Zvona customized his environment so that he couldn't
delete unmatched parens. Since he makes "(" and ")" work like m-(
and m-), this gives his editor a strong structure-editor feel. I
wouldn't want that myself, but I think it's important that people who
want to hack such things be able to.

In the KEA project that I am working on here at the Open University,
we have some applications where deleting across node boundaries needs
to be an error.

I suggest that in order to do this, one should not have to rewrite and
patch ZWEI:DELETE-INTERVAL. Rather, it would be nice if it looked like:

(DEFVAR *DELETE-INTERVAL-CRITICS* '())

(DEFUN DELETE-INTERVAL (FROM-BP &OPTIONAL TO-BP IN-ORDER-P  ...)
  (GET-INTERVAL FROM-BP TO-BP IN-ORDER-P)
  (DOLIST (FN *DELETE-INTERVAL-CRITICS*)
    (FUNCALL FN FROM-BP TO-BP))
  (MUNG-BP-INTERVAL FROM-BP)
  ...)

Then I could write:

(DEFUN DELETE-WITHIN-NODE-ONLY (FROM-BP TO-BP)
  (IF (AND (SEGMENT-BUFFER? ZWEI:*INTERVAL*)
	   (NEQ (ZWEI:BP-NODE FROM-BP) (ZWEI:BP-NODE TO-BP)))
      (ZWEI:BARF: "You may not delete across a segment boundary.")))

(PUSH 'DELETE-WITHIN-NODE-ONLY ZWEI:*DELETE-INTERVAL-CRITICS*)

which would be a lot better than what I have to do now.

In Symbolics Release 4.5 on OU Lisp Machine Alan Turing:

If you do a call to TV:MENU-CHOOSE, selecting an item which is caught by
a :EVAL and the thing EVAL'd calls TV:MENU-CHOOSE, then the outer call
will return the wrong second value (returns the same CHOSEN-ITEM as the
inner call to TV:MENU-CHOOSE returned). My guess is that the menu
resource is being prematurely recycled and that by the time MENU-CHOOSE
gets around to asking the menu for the :CHOSEN-ITEM, it (the menu) has
already been recycled, so the :CHOSEN-ITEM info is for the wrong :CHOOSE.
I did not check the code to verify my guess, however.

Making a SYN-STREAM to a local variable is a bad idea. It should be

Does c-m-Abort not run UNWIND-PROTECTs? The reason I ask is two-fold.
First, it seems to run much faster than c-Abort. Perhaps this is just
because c-Abort has to spend a lot of time deciding if it's getting
handled from different places. Second, because I just typed c-m-Abort in
the middle of a DEFSYSTEM and the file I was loading didn't get closed.
Perhaps this is just a bug in some UNWIND-PROTECT set up by LOAD.  I had
to do FS:CLOSE-ALL-FILES to close the file.

In-Reply-To: The message of 24 Sep 3 04:57-EDT from Henry Lieberman <Henry at MIT-OZ>

    Date: Thursday, 24 September 1903, 04:57-EDT
    From: Henry Lieberman <Henry at MIT-OZ>

    In Release 5.0, Experimental MIT 1.4, FEP 18, on Pigpen (3600):

    The documentation on menu items on page. 10 of the Menus chapter in Vol. 5
    of Encyclopaedia Symbolica should say that the :NO-SELECT option must appear
    BEFORE the :VALUE option if it is to work [or change it if you want it 
    order-independent].

    (TV:MENU-CHOOSE '(("Don't select me"  :NO-SELECT T :VALUE DONT-SELECT)
		      ("Select me" :VALUE SELECT)))

    works, but 

    (TV:MENU-CHOOSE '(("Don't select me" :VALUE DONT-SELECT :NO-SELECT T)
		      ("Select me" :VALUE SELECT)))

    doesn't.

The problem here is that there is not enough error checking in the menu item
parser.  Both of your examples should have given an error "unrecognized
option :VALUE" (or :NO-SELECT in the second example).  :VALUE and :NO-SELECT
are item types, not options; you can only have one per item.  Does it make
sense to say what the value when it is selected of an unselectable item is?

Unfortunately I don't have the documentation handy right now, but it seems
likely that its discussion of these issues needs to be clarified.

In Symbolics Release 4.5 on OU Lisp Machine Alan Turing:

Not being completely awake this morning, I found myself writing
WITH-INPUT-FROM-FILE (by unconscious analogy with WITH-INPUT-FROM-STRING
I suppose). It occurs to me that WITH-INPUT-FROM-FILE and
WITH-OUTPUT-TO-FILE wouldn't be unreasonable special forms to have for
the obvious simple cases. This would make the opening and closing
of files and the opening and closing of strings more similar.

Actually, it's too bad that WITH-OPEN-FILE doesn't require a pathname
object and make strings undefined so we could define
 (WITH-INPUT-FROM-STRING (x "foo") ...)
as being the same as
 (WITH-OPEN-FILE (x "foo" ':direction ':in) ...)
and leave 
 (WITH-OPEN-FILE (x (FS:PARSE-PATHNAME "foo") ':direction ':in) ...)
for opening files. LispM people need not take this paragraph
too seriously.

In general the "internal" objects returned by messages like :LABEL are not
currently documented.  I won't judge whether that's good or bad; I expect
the theory behind not including these in the original window documentation
is that a user should not need to know about them, they would clutter up
the documentation, and they were likely to change.

The defstruct you want is named TV:LABEL-MIXIN, same as the flavor that uses it.

    In Symbolics Release 4.5 on OU Lisp Machine Alan Turing:

    If you do a call to TV:MENU-CHOOSE, selecting an item which is caught by
    a :EVAL and the thing EVAL'd calls TV:MENU-CHOOSE, then the outer call
    will return the wrong second value (returns the same CHOSEN-ITEM as the
    inner call to TV:MENU-CHOOSE returned). My guess is that the menu
    resource is being prematurely recycled and that by the time MENU-CHOOSE
    gets around to asking the menu for the :CHOSEN-ITEM, it (the menu) has
    already been recycled, so the :CHOSEN-ITEM info is for the wrong :CHOOSE.

Thanks for the report.  I fixed this in the source, and also made the :CHOOSE
message to menus return the same second value, making everything simpler and
more consistent.

Incidentally this second value of TV:MENU-CHOOSE is not documented.  The value
is the menu item that was chosen (the first value is the result of executing
that menu item).  The documentation of the :EVAL and :FUNCALL menu item types
should mention that only one value is returned; the form or function may not
return multiple values back to the caller of TV:MENU-CHOOSE or sender of the
:CHOOSE or :EXECUTE message.

SpireX 10.3, Experimental ZOO 2.3, on Lisp Machine Boo Boo (LM-2):

This is rather long and involved, so hold onto your hats:

I tried to log in to Boo-Boo.  One of my User-Ids is Kaufman-David@Yale,
and since all the ARPA namespace servers were down or (in the case of
LM15) not serving, I was dumped into the debugger from
neti:add-or-change-object, saying it couldn't update Arpa|Yale in
namespace MIT.  The ludicrous thing about it was that there were no
proceed options - I could return to the Lisp Listener, or I could get
mad, but that was it.  At the very least, there should be a proceed
option for ignoring that host.  (Sorry I don't have a complete backtrace
- I picked the second option, then the first).

I went over to AI to boot LM15 and start it serving.  It got the
following error three times; it notified me once, then later on dumped
into the debugger:
	(:SITE :ZOO #<NAMESPACE MIT mumble>) is not a valid function.
In the debugger, it had gotten a :LOCAL-NAMESPACE message from
SI:PRINTER-SPOOLER-HOSTS, coming from SI:GET-HARDCOPY-DEVICE-ALIST from
ZWEI:RESET-HARDCOPY-DEVICE-OPTIONS from the SITE-INITIALIZATIONS from
LISP-REINITIALIZE (obviously, there's a lot missing there).  Both times
in the debugger, I gave the message to (net:find-object-named :site
"zoo") instead, and everything seems to be working.

I typed c-M to the debugger the first time I was in it, and LM15 went
into the normal routine, twiddling its bits and putting "Bug window
startup" into the wholine.  Then it returned to the debugger, just as if
I had sent off my bug report.  Apparently at that point things weren't
advanced enough to switch windows, but it would have been nice if c-M
had told me that there would be a bug window waiting for me later when
it finished booting.

When I finally got into the bug window, I explained all this and typed
<END>.  It dumped into the debugger saying that ZWEI:MAILER was not
defined.  For obvious reasons, I didn't think it was worthwhile using ^M
to send a bug report about THAT.

Finally, I think a good use for KMP's :tyi-or-timeout would be for
server machines, when they boot, to ask if they should enable services,
and defaultly do so.  This would be a big win, especially since people
keep booting LM15 without enabling services.

Where did these WORKER-PRESENTATION methods without source file names come from?  Also
how come SEND wasn't open-coded (is the :DRAW method interpreted, but the :DARKNESS
method compiled?)  I suspect that the :DARKNESS method was made in an oddball way
that triggered a flavor system bug.  Something related to this was patched in 243.625,
but I don't remember precisely what that patch fixed and can't tell whether it was
the same problem.

A reproducible test case would be nice, if you have one (e.g. a file that causes this
blowout when loaded into a freshly booted machine).

    What is the policy on how we distribute disks?  Do they have LMFS.FILE's?  Are
    the LMFS.FILE's initialized?  If not, why not?

Bing has long been at MIT.  I believe the answer to your questions is
"Since we ship the sources on the disks of machines, LMFS must be
initialized."

My theory is that somebody used Bing's LMFS for paging, or recently
recreated the LMFS.FILE file and has not initialized it.

I cannot reproduce this, and I suspect the example you actually evaluated differs
from the example in your mail by some typographical error.  I suspect that the
actual array x you really used was smaller, so that the x-disp array actually
runs off the end of x.

However, there are two things to say:

  - The error message you got doesn't make sense since 0 and 2 are less than 3 and 3.
    In the next major release the error message for this case is better; it
    explains exactly what happened.

  - listarray, and all the other operations that access arrays as if they were
    one-dimensional (copy-array-contents, g-l-p, etc.) cannot work on
    conformally-displaced arrays.  When I try your example I get a list of
    30 elements (not a list of 9 elements as you have a right to expect).

bug-lmdoc: The documentation of conformal displacement needs to be improved
to clarify that the pseudo-one-dimensional array operations won't do what
you expect.

In LM15:>SYS>SITE>MIT-OBJECTS.TEXT, the Papa-Bear printer, which used to
be in the MIT site but is now in the Zoo site, comes before the
definition of site Zoo.  Is this wrong?  It seems like it may be the
cause of the printer problems LM15 is having.  Would changing it
manually cause any disasters if it is wrong?

In Symbolics software,

Whenever I do (dis:write-distribution-tape) the next thing I do is
move that menu from the top left of the screen to the bottom right of
the screen so I can see the herald so I know which systems I want to
dump.  It seems like it would be useful if it popped up there in the
first place.

The documentation implies conformal indirection is valid only if the
target is an array.  Indeed, on my machine, tv:main-screen-and-who-line
returns an array indirected to a fixnum (with vma-equals-pma), and
additionally, make-array will not let you create a conformal array that
is indirected conformally to a fixnum.

That is the state of things now.  Whether or not what you want should be
allowed is, I think, a separate question.

    Bing has long been at MIT.  I believe the answer to your questions is
    "Since we ship the sources on the disks of machines, LMFS must be
    initialized."

    My theory is that somebody used Bing's LMFS for paging, or recently
    recreated the LMFS.FILE file and has not initialized it.

I'm the person who set up the proceedures for putting software
on machines being shipped, so I can state that DCP is completely
correct.

are shipped with the following on their disks:

    Does c-m-Abort not run UNWIND-PROTECTs? 
It does
					    The reason I ask is two-fold.
    First, it seems to run much faster than c-Abort. Perhaps this is just
    because c-Abort has to spend a lot of time deciding if it's getting
    handled from different places. 
Sounds probable.
				   Second, because I just typed c-m-Abort in
    the middle of a DEFSYSTEM and the file I was loading didn't get closed.
    Perhaps this is just a bug in some UNWIND-PROTECT set up by LOAD.  I had
    to do FS:CLOSE-ALL-FILES to close the file.

There are timing windows in every implementation of WITH-OPEN-FILE that
has ever been written.  They were there in IOTA.  I once made a proposal
to BUG-LISP about ways to close those timing windows, but it is NOT
easy.  Basically, the window is between the time that OPEN opens the
file and creates the stream, and the variable gets the stream as a
value.

I'm not going to reiterate my various proposals for closing this gap
again right now, but I do plan to fix a variety of control-abort issues
for Release 6, if possible.

    Dick Waters came up with the following bug. It baffled me, too, so
    I figured I'd report it.

    If you type 
      (TYI)<Suspend><Resume>
    you will be back in the TYI, but if you type
      (+ 'A) ;or anything you like to enter an error handler
    and then type
      (TYI)<Suspend><Resume>
    the Resume will take you back to the debugger rather than back to
    the TYI.

I can't reproduce this in the latest development system (249) and it's
plausible that it would have been fixed after Release 5 was generated,
either in response to your bug report or earlier when someone else
noticed it, since things in that area were changed.  So I think it's
fixed in a future release.  Thanks for the report.

    In Symbolics Release 4.5 on OU Lisp Machine Alan Turing:

    In Zmacs, I was debugging something containing:
     (PROCESS-WAIT "Tyi or Timeout"
		   #'(LAMBDA (STREAM) (SEND STREAM ':LISTEN))
		   QUERY-IO)
    I typed c-sh-E and died in the scheduler because ZWEI:*TYPEIN-WINDOW*
    was not bound.

    Making a SYN-STREAM to a local variable is a bad idea. 

It's not a "local variable", it's a special.  That doesn't
change the fact that synonym streams are a bad idea.
							   It should be
    documented as such, and the system itself should not do it if it is not
    going to work.
    -kmp

For the record, I was bit by a similar screw involving
STANDARD-OUTPUT and TERMINAL-IO, when writing diagnostics.

It didn't help that I had to fix closures in order to
get around the problem!  I wrote a function to track
down what a synonym stream indirected through (when it could)
and produce a closure over that value.

Actually, almost EVERY use of synonym streams have exactly the same
problem.  The most common synonym streams indirect through TERMINAL-IO,
which is almost always bound in a specific process.  Synonym streams can
never be passed between processes.  This fact should be documented.

Of cource, few streams are really designed to work correctly
when having IO performed from more than one process.  This
fact should be documented too.

    I don't understand why nobody else has complained about this.  Doesn't
    anyone else evaluate forms in the error handler?  Is there some trick
    I've missed?

Put the following into your init file to remove the bogus
debugger key-assignment:

dbg:
(setq *command-dispatch-list*
      (delq (assq #\c-c *command-dispatch-list*) *command-dispatch-list*))

(makunbound 'dbg:*command-dispatch-table*)
(dbg:assure-dispatch-set-up)

I don't buy for one femptosecond the argument that because we plan to
change the input-editor command someday that we should visit this kind
of lossage on ourselves and our users.  Not only is it an incredible
pain in the interim, but it has no reason to be on that key even if we
DID have the new input-editor command set.  So why do we suffer with
this lossage for still another year?

Therefore, I have removed it from the source, and strongly
suggest sneaking it into 5.2.

In-reply-to: Msg of 15 Jul 1984 12:50-EDT from "(probably) David C. Plummer" <DCP at SCRC-TENEX>

I guess it depends upon what kinds of things map to a virtual address.
If only screens do this, then since they are one of the big users of
conformal mapping, it should probably be legal, since the only other
way to achieve the same behavior is to make one array mapped to the
virtual address and then make a second mapped to the first
conformally, which means the sole purpose of the first array is to
have an array that can be mapped to conformally.

The documentation also says that Function-Q hardcopies the screen, and
makes no mention of the non screen parts of the screen (which, by the
way, come out quite ugly on an LGP when concatenated on the right
edge).  We have our Magnum Opus Symbolicorum on an altar.  I hope this
doesn't mean it is flawed.

When I actually set out to make tv:main-screen-and-who-line do the
desired thing, I ran into all the problems you mentioned and settled
for a gross kludge.  I was going to map to the screen array, but
si:change-indirect-array doesn't let you change everything you have
to, and I would have had to do what I did anyways.  The point is that

    Therefore, I have removed it from the source, and strongly
    suggest sneaking it into 5.2.

I'm surprised to hear you, of all people, suggest "sneaking" something
that could be considered gratuitous (people have lived with this since
Release 4) into a minor release on such short notice.

	TV:MAIN-SCREEN-AND-WHO-LINE returns an array which includes the portions
	of the screen past the edges of the screen.  This means that if there is
	anything out there past the official edge and you hardcopy your screen
	onto an LGP, you get funny results on the right edge of your printout.

    The documentation implies conformal indirection is valid only if the
    target is an array.

If the target is an address rather than an array, MAKE-ARRAY has no way
to find out what width you were expecting.  I suppose we could add a new
keyword for that, or use the value of the :DISPLACED-CONFORMALLY keyword
which currently is just a Boolean, but if the only reason to want it is
this bug in the screen hardcopy command, why don't we just fix the bug?

    That would be okay too, but if it is going to be able to do that,
    there ought to be a way to choose systems from that herald as well to
    reduce some of the typing.

While we're reducing typing time, the distribution dumper should understand the
concept of Releases.

It should also understand patch directories well enough so that it can
fabricate a patch directory that corresponds to the minor version level of the
systems being dumped, instead of taking whatever's there.  For example, if I
make Release 5.2 today, I should be able to keep patching System 242 or LMFS 37
and then later tell the distribution dumper to make me a 5.2 tape, and have it
construct patch directories for System and LMFS that correspond to 5.2 levels.

    Here's one for the complete loss half of the namespace code, as well as
    the completely totally losing (but at least better than it used to be
    thanks to the winning half of the namespace code) distribution tape
    system.  I'm doing dis:write-distribution-tape, and I caught my who-line
    trying to talk to SCH|G and broke in to investigate.  It seems that the
    code thought I might want to do a remote tape to some host out on the
    Arpanet and it was going to find hosts out there supporting the service
    just in case I asked which ones supported it.  Now it would be amusing
    to write this on a tape on a Dandelion at Xerox were it not so late at
    night, and were it not that speech is so much more convenient.  Really,
    there is no need to do this lookup unless I ask which ones support it,
    and then I should have a choice of specifying which sites I'm interested
    in asking about instead of getting every tape drive reachable via the
    namespace.

There is no ready way for the namespace system to know that
there are no hosts in the SCH namespace which are also in your
local site.   Consider that PARC-MAXC is in the ARPANET namespace,
as MIT-MC.  It has to check whether or not there are hosts in
that namespace at your site.

Now realize, it wasn't asking about hosts at SCH, or in the SCH
namespace.  SCH|G is a namespace server for MIT, SCRC, and ARPANET.
Your machine was trying to talk to SCH|G because it couldn't talk to
LM15 with a reasonable response time, to ask it about a much more
plausible namespace.

It was difficult to be sure about this, since you c-N'd a few frames
before using c-M to send your message.  The result is that you skipped
over the relevant information.  But looking at the source for
TAPE:FIND-TAPE-SERVICE-HOSTS, for the system that you are running, I
find it only considers hosts at the local site.

So as usual, it appears that the problem is not that the namespace is
trying to obtain an unreasonable amount of information.  The problem is
that it is turning to hosts far away over slow networks for fundamental
information.  We have been working on ways improve it's choice of what
hosts contact for information.  A number of these improvements will
appear in Release 5.2.

Just to clarify, it is (tv:main-screen-and-who-line) that I am saying
is broken, not make-array and conformal mapping.  It is trivial to
coerce the array to be conformally mapped, but it currently seems to
take the kind of code that looks better encrypted.  If it were me, I
would probably make tv:main-screen-and-who-line indirect to the screen
array of the screen instead of the buffer address and add an optional
argument to si:change-indirect-array that lets you do it conformally
if you want, since I can imagine someone might have some uses for
something like that, for example if they had some array algorithm that
looked at various sub-arrays and they did not want to cons a new array
header each time, for example if they were moving windows around a
lot.

     This note is less a notice regarding a bug than a suggestion. Would
it be very difficult to add the following features to the SORT program
in Zmacs?

     1) The power to ignore the initial "the" when sorting lines or
paragraphs (for instance "The" in "The Yankee Group" or "The New York
Times"). 

     2) The power to ignore initial non-alphanumeric characters when
sorting lines or paragraphs (for instance '"' in '"Cosmic"').

     3) The power to redefine the natural order of ASCII characters (for
instance, specifying that "_" will precede "a").

     4) The power to sort lines or paragraphs by last names (as in a
list of personal names).

It would also be nice if DIS:WRITE-DISTRIBUTION-TAPE let you write
multiple versions of systems.  Often if I am sending or moving a system
to another site, I want to move both the released and experimental
versions of the system; currently, if I try to specify a second version
of a system to dump, it replaces the first version specified.

Why would it want to do that?  Who else uses it except hardcopy?  If

not this shifted over thing that doesn't include the top and bottom,
and there should be another version that doesn't include the "Frame"

when you hardcopy it with the shifted over horizontal half of the

        Date: Saturday, 14 July 1984, 15:36-EDT
        From: Scott Cyphers <sr.ehpyc at MIT-SPEECH>

        In Release 5.1, Experimental MIT 1.4, Spire-Macros 1.9,
        Experimental Versatec 2.1, Print 34.3, Experimental Versatec-Spool 2.3,
        Experimental ZOO 2.3, Experimental ZOO-KEEPER 2.2, FEP 18, on Lisp Machine Goldilocks (3600):

        In LM15:>SYS>SITE>MIT-OBJECTS.TEXT, the Papa-Bear printer, which used to
        be in the MIT site but is now in the Zoo site, comes before the
        definition of site Zoo.  Is this wrong?

    No.  Forward references (and circular references) are handled correctly.

    					     It seems like it may be the
        cause of the printer problems LM15 is having.

    What are those?

See the message by sr.kaufman (Qux??).  Evidently, LM15 won't boot
without giving an error from the namespace.  I haven't looked at it
myself having not had time to go over yet.  The hardware has been fine
for the past several weeks (aside from the monitor) so whatever
developed happened through normal namespace interactions.  I looked at
the files, and the forward references were the only at all strange
thing I could see.

							    If it were me, I
	    would probably make tv:main-screen-and-who-line indirect to the screen
	    array of the screen instead of the buffer address
	You forgot what that function does.  The array in question includes
	stuff outside of the screen array of the screen.

    Why would it want to do that?

So that you get the who-line too, not just the main screen.

				   Who else uses it except hardcopy?  If
    it's going to do what you say, it ought to return the entire screen,
    not this shifted over thing that doesn't include the top and bottom,
    and there should be another version that doesn't include the "Frame"
    then.  Load in some borders stuff and see what it looks like on an LGP
    when you hardcopy it with the shifted over horizontal half of the
    borders concatenated version of tv:main-screen-and-who-line.

You're confused.  I'm not talking about the crap outside of the screen
array that you are seeing and don't want.  I'm talking about the
who-line, which is outside of the screen array and which you do want.
Perhaps you weren't aware that the who-line is a separate screen from
the superior of most windows?  That's the whole reason this function
exists.

	For the information of anyone who cares, as of Release 5.1 machines
	are shipped with the following on their disks:

	>PAGE.PAGE (60000)
	>LMFS.FILE (30000, including all sources, but NOT documentation)
	>V22-DEBUG.FLOD
	>TMC5-IO4-MIC.MIC.292 (105 blocks)

	synch programs
	a boot file, with a standard bogus chaos address.
	an empty >FSPT.FSPT


    What about disks which are not associated with a machine?  I mean, what
    happens when a customer orders an additional disk as an add-on to his
    existing machine?  Does he get an empty (uninitialized) LMFS partition
    on this new disk, or what?

An additional disk not ordered with a machine will probably come
just like a disk on a 3670, but might come with NO LMFS file at all.
Uninitialized LMFS partitions are not created for any disk, except
as part of the function which loads LMFS.FILE from tape.

A better way to write your function would be to allocate a menu from the
resource unconditionally, and use the length of the item list only to
control whether or not you expose the menu on the screen.  Not all menus
necessarily handle the :EXECUTE message the same way, so you shouldn't
write programs that guess what the :EXECUTE message would do if you can
avoid it.

It is called this because many menu items

In Symbolics Release 4.5 on OU Lisp Machine Alan Turing:

It seems a real misfeature that the only info seen by mouse sensitive
item type handlers is the datum of the given type.

It seems to me that it would be quite useful to be able to get at
least the window that was typed on and maybe other data.

The reason is that it may be not just the item, but the item's relation 
to a particular display which was the reason the user touched it.
eg, I might have several diagram windows with the same (as nodes)
in each but with different arcs relating the data. If the user clicks on
an item, he may mean "the item in the context of this picture", but as
nearly as I can tell there is no way to get that info back if I
am using the system-provided mouse-sensitive items stuff.

   I am forever typing C-C to the error handler, expecting to see my
   previous input expression appear, and instead invoking the <Resume>
   proceed option.

   I don't understand why nobody else has complained about this.  Doesn't
   anyone else evaluate forms in the error handler?  Is there some trick
   I've missed?

   -- Scott

In release 5, C-M-Y is the approved method for yanking back your
previous input line (M-Y rotates the input ring).  If you can get in the
habit of using C-M-Y all the time this problem won't bite you, and
you'll like what happens in ZMACS a lot more.

In spite of this, I wouldn't mind if the ^C debugger command was
retired.  It does not currently appear in the command list that C-HELP
gives, nor does it show up in proceed options list.

Bob, that is not what he wants, since it doesn't execute menu items that have

	    In Symbolics Release 4.5 on OU Lisp Machine Alan Turing:

	    There should be an advertised function which accomplishes the duty of
	    the :EXECUTE message to a menu.

	    I wanted to write a utility which was like TV:MENU-CHOOSE, but
	    immediately returned on lists of one or zero length rather than offering
	    a menu. Unfortunately, I had to parse menu item types.

	    There should be a function TV:MENU-EXECUTE and the :EXECUTE message to a
	    menu should normally just call that unless it has reason to override, in
	    which case it would probably put a call to TV:MENU-EXECUTE in an
	    otherwise clause anyway.

	    -kmp
	What you want is TV:MENU-EXECUTE-NO-SIDE-EFFECTS.
	It is called this because many menu items
	depend on having the actual menu in hand; :EXECUTE
	can handle those, but not a stand-alone function.

	Unfortunately, the function doesn't seem to be documented.

    Bob, that is not what he wants, since it doesn't execute menu items that have
    side effects.  
That's exactly the set of menu items that what he asked for
can handle.  You're right that it's not really what he wants,
but it's what he asked for.
		   Probably it's not documented because it shouldn't be called
    by anything other than the one program that it was put in for.
It's used by a lot more than one program, or at least
it used to be.

I hadn't seen (or thought of) the hack of allocating a menu just for the
sake of interpreting the menu items.  I doubt many users will think of
it either, unless we document it as the "right" way to do that.

Subject: Supdup GT40 code can firmly wedge supdup windows
To: BUG-LISPM at MIT-OZ

In Release 5.1, Experimental MIT 1.4, FEP 18, on Lisp Machine John Lennon (3600):

I get this bug frequently in a supdup connection to MC runnning SUDS with SUDS trying to
redisplay.  The only really interesting part of all of this is the state into
which it put my machine.  It leaves it in the error handler at the TV:%DRAW-LINE-INTERNAL
frame but with everything completely wedged.  E.g. that window will not talk to the
keyboard, ABORT and all other such functions have no effect, but other windows can be
selected.  The only way in which I could send this message was to select-P, grab the
window and force into the error handler, and then work my way to the point of the original bug.

I know you probably aren't interested and don't care anymore about the GT40 code, I know
that even if you do fix it that a bug fix will arrive here in 1992, and I'll go ahead and
try to fix it locally myself.  However I though you might be interested in the weird 
wedged nature of the machine when it gets the bug.

To: BUG-LISPM at MIT-OZ

In Release 5.1, Experimental MIT 1.4, FEP 18, on Lisp Machine John Lennon (3600):

Well the bug was brought on by some cadr specific constants in the code.
I've fixed up the SUDS stuff so it works for me from a 3600, if anyone else
cares they can contact me.

The wedgitude revolved around the fact that when draw-line overdrew the
screen, the still existing connection had the FULL attention of the supdup
window even though the error handler had barfed all over the top of it.

<Network>D would properly disconnect and get things rolling again.  I
could never win at all however trying to get the error handler which was
orginally entered when the draw line went off screen to pay the slightest
attention to me.  - THAT is the real bug I'm complaining about -

Just between you and me,  I can certainly understand why you'd want to keep that
GT40 emulator code a deep, dark, trade secret...

Subject: Namespace system
To: BUG-LISPM at MIT-OZ
Cc: CStacy at MIT-MC

In Release 5.1, Experimental MIT 1.4, FEP 18, on Lisp Machine Jimi Hendrix (3600):

In Zwei I read in file on from MC, and then a little while later typed
C-X C-S.  Apparently the namespace system decided that it needed to find
our about MC again during that time (I think it was looking for the best
host address.) The namespace system should not check up on such stable
hosts so often.

It seems like every other time I draw breath, the damn thing is going off
asking some computer in the LA suburbs about the machine three feet away
from me which it knew about 15 minutes ago.  

My annoyance really has little to do with my being unhappy because the
namespace server may not be working well.  I just don't think the service
should have to be invoked as often as it is, and that I should be able to
control when it is activated.

I wish I had more control over the namespace feature.
I would like the following features:

  1. A function to manually run which requests assorted information about a
     list of hosts.

  2. A bit on each host in the cache saying that this info should never
     be re-validated.   This would be set manually by the user for hosts
     whose information the user believes will not change soon.

  3. Ability to disable the namespace system, so that "unknown host"
     errors happen quickly.   A proceed option would invoke the
     entire namespace rigamarole; another option would say that once
     the information is obtained, the DONT-INVALIDATE bit would be
     set in the cache.

"The piece I'm going to repeat was written entirely for your amusement."
			(With apologies to Lewis Carroll's Humpty-Dumpty)

	At midnight, when the stars were bright,
	I grabbed a LispM with delight.

	At dawn, when grass was dewy green,
	I tried to hack the color screen.

	At noon, when shadows weren't so long,
	I tried to find out what went wrong.

	As evening fell upon the town,
	I left, 'cause the machine was down.


	I sent a message to the screen.
	I told it "This is what I mean."

	The little demons of the screen
	Refused to turn it red or green.

	The little demons' error was
	"We cannot do it, Sir, because ---"

	I bound their function cells, to say
	"It will be better to obey."

	The demons answered with a grin,
	"That's not the stack group we run in!"

	I ran them once, I ran them twice:
	They would not listen to advice.

	I wrote a whopper, large and new,
	Fit for the deed I had to do.

	The disk went thump, the disk went thrash;
	I'd made the messages rehash.

	A window then popped up and said,
	"Your mousey process now is dead."

	I said to it, I said it plain,
	"I wish to wake it up again."

	I said this very loud and clear;
	I clicked at it to make it hear.

	But it was very stiff and flat;
	It said, "You'll need the mouse for that!"

	And it was very flat and stiff;
	It said, "I'll let you wake it, if ---"

	I killed it then to let off steam
	And plunged into the Cold Load Stream.

	And when I found the windows locked,
	I pushed and popped and tried a crock.

	And when I found out what was what,
	I tried to get a handle, but ---

        In the past, when two different systems depended on the same file, DEFSYSTEM
        was smart enough not to complain and not to bother to reload the file when it
        had previously been loaded by the other system.  This functionality does not
        seem to be present any more in 5.1 Enclosed is a backtracing showing where
        MAKE-SYSTEM complained.

    It looks to me like one system was loaded with physical pathnames, and one with
    logical pathnames.  If so, it does (never has) not know if the two are the same.

I've been bitten by this one too. To avoid it, it means that you reference both 
by the same logical pathname. This means that one system has to be made dependent
on another's logical pathnames.  It should be possible to refer to the same
physical file by different logical pathnames and it should recognize that they're
the same.

Subject:  Diagram Lines in ZWEI
To: BUG-LISPM @ MIT-MC

In Symbolics Release 4.5 on OU Lisp Machine Alan Turing:

ZWEI's redisplay algorithm does not seem to be sensitive to the possibility
of wanting to redraw a diagram line without redisplaying the whole screen.

If you have a diagram line which needs to be redrawn, you must use
DIS-ALL, which forces the whole screen to be repainted. Using DIS-TEXT
and less does not work because ZWEI just inspects the text of the line
(which is null in all cases I know of), and sees it to be the same so
it thinks it needn't do any more toward updating the screen.

It is ugly to see a whole screen update in this case. There should be
a more refined mechanism than DIS-TEXT for specifying the need to just
redraw a diagram line.

    From: Kent M Pitman <KMP @ MIT-MC>

    In Symbolics Release 4.5 on OU Lisp Machine Alan Turing:

    ZWEI's redisplay algorithm does not seem to be sensitive to the possibility
    of wanting to redraw a diagram line without redisplaying the whole screen.

    If you have a diagram line which needs to be redrawn, you must use
    DIS-ALL, which forces the whole screen to be repainted. Using DIS-TEXT
    and less does not work because ZWEI just inspects the text of the line
    (which is null in all cases I know of), and sees it to be the same so
    it thinks it needn't do any more toward updating the screen.

    It is ugly to see a whole screen update in this case. There should be
    a more refined mechanism than DIS-TEXT for specifying the need to just
    redraw a diagram line.

ZWEI redisplay is not based on comparison of text strings.  It is based
on comparison of modification ticks stored with lines.  Your problem is,
I believe, that you are not calling ZWEI:MUNG-LINE on your diagram line
when you modify it.

Subject:   Read-Only lines
To: BUG-LISPM @ MIT-MC

In Symbolics Release 4.5 on OU Lisp Machine Alan Turing:

It would be nice if there were some facility for getting read-only
lines in the same way as one can get read-only nodes.

I tried setting LINE-TICK of a line to :READ-ONLY (noticing that this is
what Dired buffers have in the NODE-TICK for the buffer), but some
functions seem to assume numberness of line-ticks and things quickly
break.

The reason I wanted read-only lines is so that I could make diagram
lines which separated nodes and which couldn't be killed. In fact,
Converse should have this feature so it doesn't have to have that silly
headache of m-X Regenerate Buffer when the user accidentally kills 
a diagram line.

By the way, it seems to me slightly unaesthetic that the :READ-ONLY tick
for nodes is on the keyword package but the ZWEI:DELETED tick for lines
is on the ZWEI package.

To: BUG-LISPM at MIT-OZ
Cc: BUG-ZMACS at MIT-OZ

In Release 5.0, Experimental MIT 1.4, FEP 18, on Lisp Machine Marilyn Monroe (3600):

I asked the editor to find a file, to which request it responded by
asking me for a password to log into OZ.  Fine.  While it was looking
for the file, I selected my terminal window (using SELECT T), logged out
of OZ, logged into EE, and while that was chugging away, I re-selected
the editor (using SELECT E).

Now, much to my surprise, I found myself looking at an empty buffer,
*Buffer-2*.  The machine had created a new editor window for me.  (I did
NOT hit SELECT C-E by mistake.)  PEEK showed both editor windows, the
new one,

Edit: *Buffer-2*
    Zmacs Mode Line Window 3
	Typein Window 15
	Zwei With Typeout Unselectable 15
	Zwei Minibuffer 15
    Edit: *Buffer-2*

and the one I wanted,

Edit: PUMA.PALX PS:<PUMA.11> OZ:
    Edit: PUMA.PALX PS:<PUMA.11> OZ:
    Zmacs Mode Line Window 2
	Typein Window 2

SELECT E would not select the latter window at all, but would
consistently select the former.  After selecting the old editor window
from the PEEK display, SELECT E would select both windows fine.

(As a side note, after selecting PEEK and the editors to check my info
while composing this message, when I came back to the ZMAIL window, the
blinker failed to blink.  Selecting the Headers buffer and back to the
Text buffer, or clicking Mouse-Left would start it blinking again.)

There is undoubtedly much irrelevant info in this message, but better
too much than too little...

It is not in 5.0.  We are putting it into 5.2.

I'm not sure when 5.2 will arrive at MIT; it is complicated by AAAI.

the cursor moves properly because of the end-of-line exception.  When
you go off the left edge, the input editor does not refresh the screen
as it should.  Furthermore, a Control-L is useless when the input will
not fit inside the window.

I know this situation is not a common one, but it should be handled

Subject: Variable width for variable values.
To: BUG-LISPM at MIT-OZ

In Release 5.1, Experimental MIT 1.4, Experimental RELATUS 121.52, on Lisp Machine Robot-4 (3600):

There's a real live bug in computing the appropriate width for
choose-variable-values windows.

I have a choice box in the bottom margin of a window that causes some format
output and then re-evaluates the function which produces the window by calling
TV:CHOOSE-VARIABLE-VALUES.

The behavior is this:  On the first evaluation of the function, the box
isn't wide enough, and my last choice for each item consistently gets
bumped to the next line.  On succeeding evaluations, after the *THROW,
the box is plenty wide enough.  Very strange.

I traced some of the relevant methods and discovered that on the second and
subsequent evaluations of TV:CHOOSE-VARIABLE-VALUES, the value returned by
(BASIC-CHOOSE-VARIABLE-VALUES :APPROPRIATE-WIDTH) is larger (by anywhere from
10. to 25. pixels) than it was for the first evaluation.  Random.

The following kludge seems to fix things for me, although I have only tested
it a few times.

TV:
(DEFWHOPPER (BASIC-CHOOSE-VARIABLE-VALUES :APPROPRIATE-WIDTH) (EXTRA-WIDTH)
  (COND ((NUMBERP EXTRA-WIDTH)
	 (SETQ EXTRA-WIDTH (* 2. EXTRA-WIDTH))))
  (CONTINUE-WHOPPER EXTRA-WIDTH))

I can presumably show it to you, but my world should be loaded.  Maybe you
can spy on it sometime?

Well, I tried doing (ZWEI:MUNG-LINE line) on the diagram lines when
I wanted them to redisplay but they refused to redisplay if I simply
returned ZWEI:DIS-TEXT from my DEFCOM. Oddly, they did magically get
refreshed on some later command which didn't involve either full 
refresh or modification to the diagram line or an adjoining line, so
ZWEI must have been getting at least some of the right info.

I then tried
  (ZWEI:MUST-REDISPLAY ZWEI:*WINDOW* ZWEI:DIS-LINE LINE 0)
and it blanked the line (I guess it didn't bother to notice it had a
diagram).

I finally did
  (ZWEI:MUST-REDISPLAY ZWEI:*WINDOW* ZWEI:DIS-TEXT LINE 0)
and won. I guess I'm surprised this isn't equivalent to simply returning
ZWEI:DIS-TEXT from a DEFCOM.

Anyway, I wish all this were either more intuitive or better
documented (source code comments in an obvious place would do for now,
though I am really alluding to a Zwei internals guide, of course).

I don't know what's going on here, but it looks like JIMI and FORMAT
common denominators to both problems.  Note below at the ^^^ that the
system directory is mal-formed.  It almost looks like what was supposed
to be a CAR got turned into a CDR.  Perhaps JIMI's hardware is broken?
That could also cause JIMI to output a malformed compiled function.

    There should be a general utility for specifying whether a given range
    of text in ZWEI can be deleted (by ZWEI:DELETE-INTERVAL).

I don't like the lack of scope in your way.  I'd suggest instead that
DELETE-INTERVAL work by sending a message to the bottommost node that
includes both BP's.

    If you give TV:MENU-CHOOSE a DEFAULT-ITEM, it will return it as
    a second value even if nothing was selected.

This bug was fixed in the source when your other problem with the undocumented
second value of TV:MENU-CHOOSE was fixed.  It should appear in the next major
release.

    From: Kent M Pitman <KMP @ MIT-MC>

    In Symbolics Release 4.5 on OU Lisp Machine Alan Turing:

    I don't like the fact that the :KBD menu item uses the "selected" window
    rather than something more predictable (like using the window moused if
    it has an io-buffer and erring if not).

    In other words, I think this should be illegal for simple windows like
    TV:MENU-CHOOSE.

    As it is now, even in windows with IO buffers, if you click on a :KBD
    item in a frame which is exposed but not selected, its blip gets sent to
    the selected window (which generally doesn't want it).

    It seems to me that even TERMINAL-IO would be a safer place to send
    the blip than TV:SELECTED-WINDOW, because at least its binding is
    under program control (and could be bound, for example, in a whopper
    for a :EXECUTE message).

I agree with these comments.  This is why the documentation (MENUS p.11)
tells you to use command menus instead of using :KBD menu items.

    Is it the case that ZWEI does not correctly handle nested 
    SYS:FUNCTION-PARENT declarations? It doesn't seem to. I can provide
    test cases if that will help, but it works so badly that I think 
    they might not be needed. 

It's likely that this was at least partially fixed in more recent releases,
so please provide a test case.

    Sometimes I get infinite recursion. I think this happens possibly if
    the nested declarations have the same name but different type.

I believe there are still problems when the name is a list and the type
is not DEFUN, but probably that's not relevant to your current problem.

    Sometimes I get infinite recursion. I think this happens possibly if

    Sometimes I just can't find the definition when it ought to be findable
    from the given info.

    Sometimes m-. loops indefinitely trying to stuff the *Definitions-1*
    buffer. The loop occurs in some sort of SORT action. If I c-m-Break and
    proceed it past the sort, I am left in the right buffer, but it
    still cannot find the definition.

This code is enough different on release 5 that there isn't much I can
do.  If you gave an example that failed in 4.5, I suppose I could check
whether it still fails in 5.2.

    I get this error when the mouse is too close to the window borders.  If I go
    back up the stack a ways, move the mouse to the center of the screen, and
    proceed from there, everything works fine.  If there's no room for the menu
    from where the mouse is on the window, why not just move the mouse instead of
    barfing.   I know that I can specify a place to pop up, but I shouldn't have
    to.

It does move the mouse like that.  The reason it worked when you tried
it again is that leftover state in the window had been changed so that
it would work the second time, not that the mouse was further from the
edge of the screen.  Your backtrace is too incomplete to be sure (a
numeric argument to c-M in the debugger will let you set the backtrace
length, and in a future release if you try to send an incomplete
backtrace it asks you whether you really mean to), but my guess is that
you changed the height of the label, either by using a larger font or by
using a multiline label.  This ought to work, of course, but I can see
in the code why it wouldn't and I have fixed that in the source.  Thanks
for the report--in a future release choose-variable-values will work
better because of your help.

Incidentally your backtrace also shows that you redefine a relevant system function.
I am assuming that your redefinition did not introduce any bugs, but in general when
you do this you ought to include the source of your version in the bug report in
case it has any effect on the problem.

    Date: 23 July 1984 10:33-EDT
    From: Kent M Pitman <KMP @ MIT-MC>

    Well, I tried doing (ZWEI:MUNG-LINE line) on the diagram lines when
    I wanted them to redisplay but they refused to redisplay if I simply
    returned ZWEI:DIS-TEXT from my DEFCOM. Oddly, they did magically get
    refreshed on some later command which didn't involve either full 
    refresh or modification to the diagram line or an adjoining line, so
    ZWEI must have been getting at least some of the right info.

    I then tried
      (ZWEI:MUST-REDISPLAY ZWEI:*WINDOW* ZWEI:DIS-LINE LINE 0)
    and it blanked the line (I guess it didn't bother to notice it had a
    diagram).

    I finally did
      (ZWEI:MUST-REDISPLAY ZWEI:*WINDOW* ZWEI:DIS-TEXT LINE 0)
    and won. I guess I'm surprised this isn't equivalent to simply returning
    ZWEI:DIS-TEXT from a DEFCOM.

I checked the Release 5 sources and MUST-REDISPLAY does not even look at
its last two arguments if its second argument is DIS-TEXT.  It seems
clear that something happened to confuse you; there is no reason why calling
MUST-REDISPLAY would be different from returning DIS-TEXT from your command.
Without seeing your code I couldn't guess what that might have been.

    Anyway, I wish all this were either more intuitive or better
    documented (source code comments in an obvious place would do for now,
    though I am really alluding to a Zwei internals guide, of course).

Are the comments at the front of the file sys:zwei;displa.lisp not what
you want or not in an obvious place?  (Actually, I understand your wish
for documentation of Zwei internals.  Some day.)

    I don't know what's going on here, but it looks like JIMI and FORMAT
    common denominators to both problems.  Note below at the ^^^ that the
    system directory is mal-formed.  It almost looks like what was supposed
    to be a CAR got turned into a CDR.  Perhaps JIMI's hardware is broken?
    That could also cause JIMI to output a malformed compiled function.

This bug seemed to go away after loading patches.

        In Symbolics Release 4.5 on OU Lisp Machine Alan Turing:

        There should be a general utility for specifying whether a given range
        of text in ZWEI can be deleted (by ZWEI:DELETE-INTERVAL).

    I don't like the lack of scope in your way.  I'd suggest instead that
    DELETE-INTERVAL work by sending a message to the bottommost node that
    includes both BP's.

This sounds almost right. I like the message passing approach.

Actually, though, I can imagine a node which wants to be occasionally
read-only. If you try to delete text from both it and some unrelated node
you will not get a message sent to it so it can stop it.
If you're going to go this route, I prefer:

(DEFMETHOD (NODE :DELETE-INTERVAL) (FROM-BP TO-BP)
  (LET ((SUP (SEND SELF ':SUPERIOR)))
    (IF SUP (SEND SUP ':DELETE-INTERVAL FROM-BP TO-BP))))

That way, every node in the hierarchy gets a chance to censor the
operation via :BEFORE daemons. Presumably, the :DELETE-INTERVAL wouldn't
do the deletion (though I guess it could), so maybe

(DEFMETHOD (NODE :CENSOR :CASE :DELETE-INTERVAL) ...)

would be a more general facility that could be used by :INSERT, etc.

Anyway, keep me posted on what you decide.

If this error happens because VMS only allows 3-letter file types, there should

Subject:  More on TV:MENU-CHOOSE's 2nd return value
To: BUG-LISPM @ MIT-MC

In Symbolics Release 4.5 on OU Lisp Machine Alan Turing:

If you give TV:MENU-CHOOSE a DEFAULT-ITEM, it will return it as
a second value even if nothing was selected.

I claim it would be more useful to have it return NIL as the s.

In some cases this means writing
 (MULTIPLE-VALUE (CHOICE CHOSEN-ITEM) (TV:MENU-CHOOSE ... DEFAULT-ITEM))
 (SETQ DEFAULT-ITEM (OR CHOSEN-ITEM DEFAULT-ITEM))
where perhaps formerly
 (MULTIPLE-VALUE (CHOICE DEFAULT-ITEM) (TV:MENU-CHOOSE ... DEFAULT-ITEM))
would have sufficed.

On the other hand, it would also mean that the caller of a menu list he
did not construct would know for sure whether the mouse was waved off
or whether a menu item was executed, returning NIL.

I find it exceedingly frustrating in a few cases not being able to
detect the difference between these two cases. I had always assumed that
this was what the chosen-item was about, but I have traced several bugs
in menu behavior in my system to this problem.

This relates to mail from Moon last week about documenting the second
return value from this function. The new documentation should be clear
on when/if the second return value can be NIL.

Subject:  Menu items of :KBD type
To: BUG-LISPM @ MIT-MC
cc: CWH @ SCRC-STONY-BROOK

In Symbolics Release 4.5 on OU Lisp Machine Alan Turing:

I don't like the fact that the :KBD menu item uses the "selected" window
rather than something more predictable (like using the window moused if
it has an io-buffer and erring if not).

In other words, I think this should be illegal for simple windows like
TV:MENU-CHOOSE.

As it is now, even in windows with IO buffers, if you click on a :KBD
item in a frame which is exposed but not selected, its blip gets sent to
the selected window (which generally doesn't want it).

It seems to me that even TERMINAL-IO would be a safer place to send
the blip than TV:SELECTED-WINDOW, because at least its binding is
under program control (and could be bound, for example, in a whopper
for a :EXECUTE message).

It would be nice if it were possible to have read-only lines in Zwei.
I have some diagram lines which do not want to be removed, though
the rest of the buffer wants to be modifiable.

Converse could  use a similar technique and avoid this silliness about
  m-X Regenerate Buffer
which seems basically to be an apology for incomplete error checking
upon deletion.

Btw, why is ZWEI:DELETED (a valid LINE-TICK) on the Zwei package, but
:READ-ONLY (a valid NODE-TICK) on the keyword package? Shouldn't these
be consistent for simplicity's sake?

-kmp

ps I hope I'm not repeating myself with this note.
   My net connection hung trying to send a similar one the other
   day, and I wanted to be sure it was on file.

Subject:  Nested uses of SYS:FUNCTION-PARENT declaration
To: BUG-LISPM @ MIT-MC
cc: KMP @ MIT-MC

In Symbolics Release 4.5 on OU Lisp Machine Alan Turing:

Is it the case that ZWEI does not correctly handle nested 
SYS:FUNCTION-PARENT declarations? It doesn't seem to. I can provide
test cases if that will help, but it works so badly that I think 
they might not be needed. 

Sometimes I get infinite recursion. I think this happens possibly if
the nested declarations have the same name but different type.

Sometimes I just can't find the definition when it ought to be findable
from the given info.

Sometimes m-. loops indefinitely trying to stuff the *Definitions-1*
buffer. The loop occurs in some sort of SORT action. If I c-m-Break and
proceed it past the sort, I am left in the right buffer, but it
still cannot find the definition.

    The problem is that the first sublist is dotted.  I can't think of any way
    that the make-system code could have done this; I'd sooner believe that
    someone edited the file by hand and typoed.  Unfortunately I can't check
    this because I don't know what physical host corresponds to the logical host
    RL:.

PIG:[RELATUS].  Subsequent make-systems didn't bomb this way.

    I did (PROBEF "pig:[Henry]foo.abbrev")

    If this error happens because VMS only allows 3-letter file types, there should
    be some way to inquire what a valid file type is. 
(send <VMS-pathname> :VALID-TYPE-P <type>).  This isn't documented because
it's internal, but you can safely use it.  I don't understand why you feel
this is what you want to do, though.  Can you explain why you think this
should be a documented feature, rather than part of the implementation of
the pathname system?
						      I'd actually prefer this
    return NIL instead of an error.
(condition-case ()
   (probef <foo>)
  (fs:pathname-error nil))

It certainly should not be doing this condition-case itself; after all,
it DOES indicate that it got illegal input, and that there was something
wrong with whatever was that supplied the string.

    but my guess is that you changed the height of the label, either
    by using a larger font or by using a multiline label.  

Good guess.  There's a multi-line label. I'll let you know if it bombs
with a single-line label.

    This ought to work, of course, but I can see in the code why it
    wouldn't and I have fixed that in the source.  Thanks for the
    report--in a future release choose-variable-values will work
    better because of your help.

Maybe we should get the fix before the AAAI demo?

    Incidentally your backtrace also shows that you redefine a
    relevant system function. I am assuming that your redefinition did
    not introduce any bugs, but in general when you do this you ought
    to include the source of your version in the bug report in
    case it has any effect on the problem.

OK.  It was just a DEFF.

    In Release 5.0, Experimental MIT 1.4, FEP 18, on Lisp Machine Marilyn Monroe (actually, ROBOT-1)(3600):

    Why does this happen? I was trying to write a file onto Vulcan, which was up at the
    time, because I was able to log-on from the system console, although not through
    a concentrator.

It probably didn't respond to the LispM for the same reason it didn't
respond from the concentraotr.  Being "up" from the system console does
not mean it is "up" on the network.

    >>Error: HEPHAESTUS (at Chaos address 3152) did not respond to a FILE 1 request.

    Booting robot 1 gives the following fun error:

Please use 5.1.  I believe the 5.1 worlds at MIT
will not get this problem (because they were made
later, not because the bug is fixed).  If you encounter
this problem in 5.1, let us know.

In Release 5.1, Experimental MIT 1.4, Experimental 3D_Vision_system 1.0,
FEP 18, on Lisp Machine Robot-3 (3600):

The readline EOF option is not working.
The documentation says that if EOF-OPTION is NIL, the second
value returned is an EOF-FLAG. The flag is returned as NIL
under normal circumstances but when the file runs out,
READLINE only returns one value: NIL (the flag, which
should then be t, isn't even there)

It was trying to report an error in contacting the namespace server and
the stack was too small.  In Release 5 many of the default stack sizes
are crazy, as if they were trying to fit into a minicomputer with a tiny
address space.  I believe I have fixed all of this in the source now;
thanks for the report.

We have had some problems with references to unallocated memory.  Since we do
area hacking and resetting, this is always a potential problem.  I found to
day that binding DEFAULT-CONS-AREA in the context of format and signal has,
thusfar, (fingers crossed) eliminated these problems.

(DEFUN DBG:SIGNAL (FLAVOR &REST INIT-OPTIONS)
  (WITH-CONS-AREA SI:WORKING-STORAGE-AREA	;my macro should be in the system too

Perhaps this should be incorporated into the system in order to make it more
reliable for those who hack areas.

 Sexuality and the Physician


\end{center}











      Physicians grow in confidence and competence through practice and
experience, medical students are taught again and again, but for that most
challenging confrontation, the first time, one cannot practice.  The only
softening of its blunt arrival comes from first plunging into one's
imagination, recognizing the situation that would, on its first time, shock
or unsettle, and exploring all the consequences one's feelings could create.
Those for which the average medical student is least prepared, even when
trained rigorously in medicine and ethics, Nancy Gagliano suggested as the
premise for tonight's meeting, are situations in which sexuality abruptly
bares itself in an otherwise sterile professional setting, in performing
one's first pelvic exam, for example, or extracting one's first sexual
history.

     For Nancy, the recognition of how unnerving the intrusion of sexuality
could be in a professional situation startled her.  She had spent the summer
doing library research for a neurologist at the Veteran Administration's 
Hospital, when he asked that she investigate the dentate ligament,
which runs between the corpora cavernosa of the penis.  Now she had not
only to read the literature, but also to dissect human specimens!
"I couldn't admit to the big, friendly man who ran the anaytomy lab
what I needed.  I stalled.  Finally I said, 'I need some specimens;'
and then I shrieked, 'some PENISES!'"

     In her future as a physician, Nancy wondered, how would she ever
be comfortable discussing intimate aspects of the body with her patients if
she
could not even say the word "penis" to an anatomist?  She acknowledged
that after seeing more patients, she would undoubtedly become more com-
fortable in the clinic with not only the vocabulary but also the entire
subject of sexuality but that it could only ease her trepidations to 
face them now. 

     Thus she ushered in the meeting's topic, "Sexuality and the Physician"
with a baring of her own apprehensions.  She hoped that by explicitly
introducing the multifaceted role sexuality plays in the daily practice
of medicine, she could incite the group to air similar anxieties and appre-
hensions, share attitudes and experiences and thereby educate and liberate
itself in a subject largely neglected in formal curriculums.  Her incite-
ment resulte in a discussion which ranged further than the issue of sexuality
into the fundamental aspects of the patient-physician relationship.  The
group confronted the barrier imposed by the roles that patient and physician
play and asked when it must be torn down in order to reach the underlying 
naturalness and sensitivity of ordinary humanity.

     Several articles the group had read helped to provide starting-points
for the discussion.  The first, by Julius Buchwald in                       
reported the beneficial results of a similar seminar in which students 
beginning ob-gyn rotations revealed emotional attitudes and reactions 
to performing the first pelvic examination.  Nancy summarized their
main fears: 1) of hurting the patient, 2) of being inept or being judged
inept, 3) of the patient or oneself getting sexaully aroused, and 4)of
finding the patient and/or the situation repulsive.  

     These concerns were in turn mirrored and elaborated on by the group as
they discussed intimate clinical examinations and situations.  Nancy
Gagliano wondered, "How will I walk in and do a genital exam on a young
attractive male?  I wouldn't be able to do it now without smiling and
blushing."  The patient would sense her embarrassment and lack of profession-
alism, and surely, she thought, she would only grow more self-conscious.
However, after her experiences this summer, she understood better what
was going on inside herself and perceived the problem as one of learning
to treat all bodies in a non-sexaul way, when she had been accustomed
to handling only certain male bodies in a sexual way.  It would be fascinating
to perform her first pelvic exam, yet at the same time awkward and disquieting
to touch a female patient.  The kay to overcoming her anxiety, she thought,
would be to be able to separate at will the human body from its sexuality.

     (               ) wondered why she did not share the worry some of her
friends expressed of becoming aroused while examining patients.  Was it
because her feelings on the subject were still in the "pluripotential
stage" and she had not yet reached a decisive attitude or because she
consciously blocked out her fears?  If the latter, then she worried what
would happen if she did get aroused by patients; her guilt would be
magnified by its unexpectedness.  "On the other hand," she said, "I do
worry that I might arouse my patient, by making a wrong move or being too 
tentative and schoolgirlish."

     (                     ) said that he had heard stories of male patients
getting erections under the examination of the more incompetent I.C.M.
students.  Allan Hobson doubted the report saying he'd never  known or heard
of a patient to get so aroused.  "As for myself," he continued, "I've
always been too nervous under the circumstances to feel anything sexual."

     Echoing Allan,  (                      ) said that her own performance
anxiety would be so high, she simply wouldn't be able to find the situation
erotic.  Steven Denlinger doubted for another reason that he could
be aroused in clinical situations.  "I have a history," he said,"of
decidedly not finding medical pictures of nudes erotic."

     "But what happens," countered (                ), "when the body is
living, breathing, warm, and standing in front of you?"

     Analyzing these concerns on another level, Clare Bloom admitted that
she had also worried how she would manage an aroused patient, but that she
had reognized a trick in hr thinking: as when she had first performed
venupuncture and nervously worried about her patient's nervousness,
now she felt she had projected her own anxiety about getting aroused onto
the patient.  "I can distill my nervousness, and not feel it, simply by
putting it onto someone else!"

     Worse for him than fears of sexuality, said (               ), was the
prospect of examining a "250-300 pound body.  It would revolt me, and yet I
would feel guilty for my disgust."  This concern struck a chord in the
group.  (                      ) said she dreaded above all the confrontation with
obesity, and (                    )
 confessed that he had been apalled in his third
year of medical school by the extent of human ugliness.  One unnamed student,
described by (             ), was so worried about seeing fat patients that
he planned to brave Boston's 'combat zone' for the first time to photo-
graph particularly fat nd ugly people in order to desensitize himself in 
preparation for the clinic.  Surely a patient with a personal history could
never be as offensive as such photographs, commented (                )!

     Until now the discussion had dealt with the problems of confronting
physical aspects of sexuality in a clinical setting, in switching from
a sexual to a clinical attitude when in intimate contact with another body.  
What might happen to us, though, asked(                        ), when we then 
switched back to the sexual setting?   Would the clinical sights and experi-
ences change our views of our personal seual lives?

     The answers must depend on what one's attitudes toward sex had been
before starting in the clinic, said (                   ).  If one's
sexual experiences had been overly objective and dijoint from the rest
of one's life, she continued, then, yes, the clinical view of sexuality
might be even more alienating.  But if one's sexuality were well-defined and
integrated in one's life, then surely it could sustain new comfrontations 
from the clinical realm.

     Clare Bloom extended the question, wondering whether "once we begin to
see living pathology in the whole body, will we be able to look at friends
and lovers in the same way as before?"  Allan Green answered that his 
colleagues and he, although not unaffected by thier clinical experiences,
had not changed so dramatically as to lose their nervousness or sensitivity
during delicate situations.  Their humanity had been preserved, he
concluded.

     Recalling her dissections of human penises, Nancy Gagliano said
that she'd had the distinct fear she would not be able to look at the
erect penis of her lover again without seeing the erect penis of a
cadaver.  Although she did have flashbacks occasionally,she said, more
importantly, she felt more comfortable with genitals as a result of
her work.  Simply by becoming more familiar with the anatomy of
sexuality, she could better view genitals as parts of a whole rather
than as parts separate in themselves.  Several others agreed on the
beneficial effects of such familiarity and knowledge   

     Allan Hobson proposed that although it would seem that in switching 
between settings, one might get one's wires crossed, the context wielded
a remarkable power to keep them straight.  "The context explains why
I'm in no way aroused in clinical/pathological settings, and yet, having
seen all sorts of pathology, I'm in no way impaired in non-clinical 
settings."
      
      The patients too are not simply passive objects in the clinical 
situation but contribute to its dynamics with their own feelings and 
attitudes.  The burden of one's role as a physician is lifted not only
by closely examining one's feelings, but also by shifting to the patient's
point of view.  Two articles the group read illustrated this shift.  In
"The Pelvic Examination: A View From the Other End of the Table,"  Joni 
Magee suggests ways to make the pelvic exam less unpleasant for the
patient, base on her experiences both as a patient and gynecologist.
Implicit in her article is the urge to focus on the patient's feelings 
as if they were one's own; one can thus displace one's discomfort in
a healthy way and gain new insight into the situation.  

     Along similar lines, Judith Mitchell in "Male Adolescents' Concern
About a Physical Exam Conducted By a Female" present findings that the
average male adolescent is afraid of a female examiner touching him; afraid
specifically of her touching his genitls; afraid of her not taking his
word on his health; and, most of all, "afraid of what the other guys would
think" to know he had been examined by a female.  She argues that these
concerns should be honored in such examinations with careful consideration.
Nancy remarked that the article was important also for illuminating the fact
that although "men may have a corner on the market" in examining the opposite
sex, one must consider equally the difficulties and concerns that arise when
female physicians examine men.

     Other articles that Nancy summarized dealt with more subtle
attitudes affecting the interaction between patient and physician.
The first, by (                     ), reported a bias amongst patients
towards the physician's gender.  All patients, male or female, were
more likely to choose a male over a female g.p., but males were much
less likely than females to choose a female g.p., so that female g.p.s
had a patient population 70% female, 30% male, whereas male g.p.s had
one 50% female, 50% male.

     Another study reported a correlation between the attractiveness of the
physician and the openness of the patient in reporting his symptoms. 
Generally, a patient gave more information to a doctor of the same sex, but,
on the whole, patients told most to a highly attractive male doctor.  
Members of the seminar raised objections, however, to the method of the
study, in which a subject looked at pictures of physicians that had been
rated on physical attractiveness and chose those to whom he would most likely
tell his problems.  Allan Green said that attractiveness in the actual
presence of the physician might be measured in terms different from
physical qualities, such as ability to listen or to make the patient feel at
ease; furthermore, his own observations of successful physicians didn't
concur with the results.  (                     ) also pointed out
that the concept of attractiveness varied widely; how could the pictures be
accurately rated when males may equate it with strength and power, while
females may view attractiveness as something completely different?  Nancy
agreed that the study ignored the live patient-physician interaction,
and, harking back to the earlier discussion, Alan Green commented that
the interaction might even change significantly if the physician was so
attractive as to actually arouse the patient.

     Yet if the results were to be accepted, how might they be interpreted,
asked (                     )?  Did they mean that attractive male doctors were
trusted more than female ones?  Steven Denlinger wondered if the phenomenon
might not be similar to what happens at a cocktail party, when one tries
to seek out and hold the attention of the person he finds most attractive;
the patient may have similar desires and fantasies in trying to describe 
his problems so well that he elicits the physician's personal interest
in response.   Nancy commented that the bias may simply reflect the fact that
there are more male than female physicians; the males therefore have more
patients and the females haven't yet been fully accepted or treated equally
by society.

     In a similar study that Nancy reported, the physician's bias towards
the patient's gender was revealed.  Physicians were three times more 
likely to describe a female's complaint - illustrated in a vignette -
as psychosomatic than a male's, and more likely to prescribe sedatives 
to her than to him.  On the other hand, physicians tended to deny the
emotional aspects of a male's complaint and instead to treat it as purely
physical, further denying the less open male patient of emotional and
psychological support.  

    In light of these statistics, (                        )'s anecdote
was particularly interesting.  She once worked under a very tough, machismo
ex-Marine policeman, who, hearing of her plans for medical school, said
he would 'love to go to a female doctor,' that he couldn't tolerate a 
male touching his body.  Perhaps, (                ) wondered, when
"push came to shove," he might have preferred the traditional male, but she
felt there was truth in his desire: many men find themselves physically
more comfortable and emotionally more intimate with women and this ease
may extend to the clinic.

     Nancy then introduced another aspect of the patient-physician
relationship.  Delicate clinical examinations normally arouse fears and
discomforts, she said, yet they have the potential also to evolve into
abusive situations, in which feelings on both sides may change radically.
Where is the line drawn, and how do the attitudes of patients and
physicians change when abuse threatens?

      [Insert]

  (                 ) told a simialr story of a gynecologist who
"put his patients on the table and instead of a speculum inserted his
penis."  His patients, generally of a low socio-economic class, although
certainly aware that his behavior was abnormal, had never accused him,
and he had been neither arrested nor prosecuted.

     Allan Hobson remarked that these silent patients were most likely 
intimidated by the medical context, in which they played an ignorant,
supplicant role, and dared not question the physician's procedure.  Some 
certainly blamed themselves for the incomprehensible occurrence of sex.
Nancy added that some patients, should they have had the courage, might not
have known what they could do to defend themselves.

     The question then arose of how physicians with such potential to 
abuse patients were allowed into the profession.  (             )
related an experience he had as a third year medical student on a gynecology
rotation.  A senior resident who was generally believed to have a sexual
problem one morning made a revealingly crude comment about his activities
with female patients.  On another occasion when (               )'s female
partner asked if she could do anything to help in the O.R., the resident
replied , "Yeah, take off all your clothes."  When his behaviour later
came up in conversation, he admitted to (                   ) that he had a
problem, but that he had gone into gynecology specifically to "resolve
it," by exposure.  Allan Hobson remarked that screening should, but clearly
didn't, eliminate that type of problem-solving.

     Nancy wondered if it were true that the incidence of such sexual abuse 
were highest among gynecologists and psychiatrists.  Alan Green replied,
yes, they, of all physicians, have the most intimate contact with patients."
He asked the group to consider, however, is it were ever appropriate for 
a physician to have a sexual relationship with a patient to whom he is 
attracted, whether inside or outside the medical context.  (            )
thought that in any therapeutic setting, whether psychological or physical,
the professional relationship precluded a more personal one, and if the
boundary were crossed, the patient should post-haste be referred to another
physician.  The conclusion voiced by Alan Green was that in no circumstance
could such an intimate relationship be justified; the patient, whether
a woman in stirrups or a man in a blood-pressure cuff, is in an "extremely 
vulnerable position" and the physician must recognize his power and not take
advantage of it.  Even when affairs or marriages between patient and physician
occur long after treatment has ended, they cannot be condoned.


     Having highlighted these tensions involved in delicate clinical situa-
tions, the group then turned to weays of ameliorating them.  Nancy Gagliano
began by considering how one simply talked about sexualtiy with a patient.
Taking a sexual history is in itself a delicate procedure and Nancy 
illustrated the point by contrasting two questionnaires; the first, taken
from a counselor's examination, included questions such as : "What are
{your} individual needs for optimal sexual functioning?," "How do {you
and your partner} communicate about sexual issues?," "what is {your}
masturbatory behaviour?", and "how do {you} meet {your} needs for intimacy?"
while the second, from a dermatology exam, asked, "how frequently per
month {do you have} intercourse?,"how frequently do you masturbate?" and
"how is {your partner's} sexual functioning?"  Because dermatology deals
with a patient's skin and hence his appearance, which very much influences
his sexuality, and the article from which the latter questions were taken
purported to teach its readers how to take a sexual history, Nancy found
"appalling" the manner in which the patients were attacked by demands
for "numbers of times" rather than treated as individuals with needs as
the first questionnaire did.  She described an incident she had witnessed
in the operating room where a male patient required urgent shortening
of the tunica albuginea to relieve torsion of the testes.  The patient
requested very neat stitches as he was a striptease dancer and "jokes
flew around the room, where everyone else but the attendant was female."
The resident surgeon after unsuccessfully quizzing the patient asked the
attendant what the odd mark was on the patient's penis and was told
"a human bite, of course." Turning to the patient, she asked, "How
did you get that on your penis?' and he replied, 'Dear, you don't ask
"what's that," you ask, "who bit you?"'  The important thing in talking about
the patient's sexual history, Nancy concluded, was not to reveal one's
bias or judgment, but rather to be bold and to provoke an open discussion.


     (                 )pointed out that although that guideline worked in
dealing with experienced but closed patients, igt might not work, for
example, with inexperienced adolescents.  "If one followed Mitchell's 
instructions and asked, 'when did you first masturbate?' of a young boy
who hadn't yet masturbated, he might feel humiliated, afraid or forced to 
lie."  It was difficult in some situations,(               ) suggested,
to know whether to be bold or tentative.  

     (                )a greed and said that over the summer a similar 
question had arisen with young male diabetics.  It's a fact that male 
diabetics become impotent as the disease progresses, so when does one 
break it to a severely afflicted young patient?  A 15-year-old struggling
with the normal throes of adolescence and with diabetes in addition, 
probably would not be able to handle the knowledge. Yet the 'rule' of
'5 years after the onset of the disease' seems simple enough in the
classroom.(              ) suggested that one ought certainly to get an
idea of the patient's sexual life first before broaching the subject
of impotence, but that the problem remained of how to discuss sex with
a young patient.  Should one wait until the patient brought up the 
subject?  Steven Denlinger commented, "If I were to lose erectile func-
tion in a few years, I'd certainly want to know about it as soon as
possible."(                   ) added that it one said nothing, in
the case of a well-documented disease like diabetes, the patient would
most likely read or hear about the facts elsewhere, but noted that 
"he may not come back to discuss them with you, but instead just get
depressed."  Alan Green suggested that it was the physician's obligation
to give the patient the possible outcomes whether or not he might learn 
elsewhere, but Allan Hobson qualified the remark saying there could be
no absolute rule -- one could never, categorically, tell each patient all
aspects of his disease and prognosis; :some patients want to know, others
make it clear they do not want to know, and some you know would over-
react in terror at the bad news."  The same problem also occurs in
choosing when to tell a patient he has a terminal illness. "My guideline,
in part, " Allan said, "is to move as far as I can before encountering
defensive or phobic anxiety."


     Much of the art of medicine is in learning when to say what, agreed
Alan Green.  As another example, he raised the problem of giving a prognosis
to a patient with multiple sclerosis, a disease which varies widely in its
progression.  A patient may experience two or three isolated bouts in a
lifetime or he may be confined to a wheel chair within three years of the
diagnosis. "Should one give him hope by giving only the first prognosis, or
should one explain the whole continuum of possibilities?"

     In reply(                        )
 reiterated Allan Hobson's point, saying 
that what one told a patient must depend on his particular history, both
inside and out of the medical relationship.  He related a personal story.
"I once had a psychiatric patient who developed neurological symptons
and was hospitalized while I was away.  When I returned, I was faced with
chossing the best method to break the news of a multiple sclerosis diagnosis
to him.  I conferred with the neurologist and we both agreed that it was his 
duty to deliver the diagnosis, but only if I could join my patient immediately
afterwards to assess his reaction and offer him support."  The patient closed
his ears to the worst in his prognosis and confided to Steve that he was
afraid to go out into the world after having battled a psychiatric illness for
15 years, only to be struck down by a physical one.  He would rather never 
recover from his psychiatric illness, he said.  On the other hand, his family,
who were involved in the ongoing psychotherapy, wanted to know specific 
answers, to know all possible outcomes.  In dealing with the neurologist, the
patient, and the patient's family, with their different levels of attitudes
and authority, (                   ) had to make difficult decisions for which 
there were no hard and fast rules, only feelings to play by.

     Steven Denlinger marveled at the seeming smoothness of (              )'s
experience in pooling resources to cope with the patient's crisis.  "When I 
worked in the cardiac unit at the Brigham," he said,"I was required to trans-
cribe verbatim my interviews with patients and then to discuss them line-
by-line with my supervisor, to decide whether I had said the right thing at
the right time."  In other specialties and at higher levels, did such instruc-
tive scrutiny of one's techniques take place? 

     In one's residency,(                   ) replied, such scrutiny did
take place, but later, one simply had to learn by experience.  One must
accept one's mistakes and like a comedian who makes a bad joke know how to turn
bad to good and when not to repeat oneself.

     "Such comfort as I've developed," emphasized Allan Hobson,"has come from
patients, not other doctors.  They show you how far to go, if you try to
keep in touch with your own feelings -- a difficult task since M.D.s are not
supposed to have feelings.  Patients themselves are not as fragile as we
think; they have their own resources, and they might some burdens easier
than we do?"

     The remarkable but simple thought that the patients might not simply be
helpless subjects but rather helpful colleagues took hold and cheered the
group.  Some recalled illustrative instances: Once (                  ) worked 
as an orderly at the bottom of the hierarchy in a hospital, performing tasks
considered unpleasant or improper for female staff. , one of which was
euphemistically called "to finish a bath."  He would wash the genitalita of
bedridden men after the female nurses had bathed their other parts.  Once while
doing so for a young quadriplagic, he was embarrassed to see his patient's
penis erect.  Immediately however, the young man perceived (             )'s
feelings and said "don't worry about that; it happens all the time."

     Another time he gave an enema to an elderly man who was ready and
anxious to leave the hospital.  He could detect (              )'s discomfort 
and being both patient and religious, began to pray audibly not only for
himself, but also for (                )).  "I suspect that a lot of
patients we'll work with will be veteran," concluded (                 ),"and
will be willing to give of their experience and knowledge."

     Steven Denlinger recalled a similar example from an article on medical
ethics by Steve Hoffman in the Alumni Bulletin a few years ago.  The author
described learning arterial punctures on an elderly woman, unsuccessfully 
jabbing her arm again and again.  She responded by shouting to a passing 
attendant, 'This medical student really knows his stuff,' because  in prac-
ticing on her, he had made her feel a comrade in his learning and healing.

     The discussion had gradually come to pinpoint the conventional roles
of physician and patient as much of the source of unease in delicate
clinical situations.  In fact, the group realized,a  simple way to deal with
tensions or fears was to loosen the physician's garb when it became too
restrictive, and to reveal the underlying human engagement.  Using one's
feelings as guides rather than repressing them was often the way to the
most humane, therapeutic solution in a difficult clinical problem, Allan 
Hobson had said.  Yet the roles must also be maintained enough to impose
responsibility and control, the group concluded in the remainder of the
discussion.

     (                      drew on the new sense of sensitivity and relief by
asking whether it was acceptable to simply admit one's feelings, such as
to say:"I'm a bit new at this -- my hands may be a bit cold."  Steven 
Denlinger echoed her, saying he'd thought about that question for the last two
years.

     Allan Hobson encouraged the students to do so; "no matter how much exper-
ience one has," he said,"one should never expect to be perfectly confident.
When, in certain situations, I am forced to make a tentative approach to a
patient's problem, I always begin by confessing, 'I'm not certain this is
correct...' and only then offer my opinion."

     But(                  )    raised the possibility that in some delicate
examinations, for example, a pelvic, one's admission of inexpertise might
instead make the patient more uncomfortable.

      Allan replied that there was a difference in being comfortable or
uncomfortable about one's own discomfort.  "If I accept my discomfort in a
normal situation and state it without spreading anxiety and panic, and
instead elicit my patient's alliance and cooperation, then I make him 
feel better.  If I spill out my anxiety, without having thought it through, 
then I make him feel worse."

     It wasn't always so easy to admit one was still a student and not yet
fully qualified, said Clare Bloom.  Often when accompanying a clinical tutor
she would be introduced to a patient as 'Dr. Bloom.' a title she would then
be forced to challenge if she wished to alleviate her inexpertise by
explaining that she was not a doctor, and in fact, learning from the
patient himself.

     Steven Denlinger commented that in the previous years some of the I.C.M.
students had been angered by just such authority from the attending physicians;
particukarky when after having been touted as doctors, the students might
worry they wouldn't know an 'ear from an elbow' on the physical exam.  They
had suggested that students be given a unique and distinctive garb for 
immediate identification in the hospital.  A variety of eager suggestions arose
from the group.

     Many patients, said (                   ), would easily recognize medical
students simply by their behaviour and attitudes.  She related her story of 
working in a hospital where she did not perform physical examinations on 
patients but discussed with them details of theor personal lives such as
impotence caused by illness.  Sometimes she would feel compelled to remind 
patients that she was only a medical student and they would usually reply, "Oh,
I know, that's the only reason I was talking to you."

     "What do you think that meant?" asked Allan Hobson.

     "That they were hostile to doctors," replied (                  ).

     She further explained that because she was there to learn how people
cope with illness, she had more time to spend with them, and never imposed
a schedule on them.  They undoubtedly felt freer and more willing to open
up to her and help her.

     Alan Green agreed that as a student one has a very special relationship
with the patient.  "As a student, you aren't ultimately responsible for the
care of someone's illness and therefore his attitude toward you will be 
different, more tolerant, understanding, and sympathetic than toward his
doctor."

     If, on the contrary, the patient's attitude were obnoxious or offensive,
there would be nothing wrong in confronting him, concluded the group.  
(                     ) confessed that a "tough guy" making rude comments
would unnerve her more than a patient with an erection.   Allan Hobson said
that in this new situation there were again no absolute rules on how to
handle it, but that one had to be sensitive to the motivation between the
patient's behaviour.  Alan Green said, "If you're a psychotherapist, talk
about it."  Nancy emphasized that one oughtn't feel there is such "holiness"
about the examination room that one couldn't say straight to the patient, 
when the situation has gone too far,"Either you cooperate, or I won't be able 
to help you."


      "Not all medical students belong to William James Seminars; where do
most learn what we've taught ourselves tonight?" asked (                   )
Nancy related an experience, again from her summer's work, which revealed that
some doctors never learn.  She observed a physician performing the Doppler
technique on an elderely man to determine the patency of the dorsal arteries
and veins of his penis.  After half an hour of the operation, the patient,
very upset, asked what was wrong and the physician merely shrugged him off.
Nancy interpreted his inability to discuss sexual dysfunction with the patient
as an unwillingness to venture into an area where he knew little, but she
emphasized that even without all the answers, a doctor must know how to deal
with a patient's fears.

     Is the necessary emotional and sexual education ever taught in a formal
curriculum?  Students mentioned courses in sexual dysfunction, human
reproductive pathophysiology, and human sexuality, which dealt largely
with the physical aspects of sexuality.  In  the introductory psychiatry
course, however, Alan Green said psychological aspects such as the demystifi-
cation of the doctor's task in treating sexual problems were probed and
 afilm of several downright funny but appalling scenes between doctors and
patients was used to illustrate the points madein lecture.

    (                )  described the reaction his class in the second year
of medical shool had had to an explicit film on homosexuality: silence. 
The instructors abruptly ended the class, the last of the course, and
departed.  During the film it was clear that some strong emotional responses
had been elicited from the audience but afterwards there was no discussion 
whatsoever.

    (                 )'s story prompted (              ) to describe the most
popular course in his undergraduate school, which explored human sexuality
through films and discussions.  "The small discussion groups saved the course,"
said (                      ) "I compare my medical school education with what
I learned then, which gave me much better education in sexuality and I feel
for those people who don't get it here."

     "Society in general expects us to be much better trained in sexuality
than we are," nancy said.  "Society expects us to be the ones who are
knowledgable and comfortable and who take the initiative.  We cannot wait
for the patients to become so uncomfortable that they must confront the 
issue."  Her words again pointed to the role that physicians are expected
to play, but here to its necessary and beneficial aspects.  A physician
who does not live up to the responsibility of his role can experience
no relief in playing it down, only failure.

     Two reactions from the group summarized the conclusions that had been 
steadily illuminated.  (                ) said that the acceptance of
his role as physician had come to him as a revelation; that it gave him 
strength and made the responsibility it required him to shoulder seem reasonable and bearable.  Yet at the same time, he knew that he should always fall
back on his feelings as the best guide to what was happening.

     The feeling of the group towards the concerns they had expressed was 
reflected in (              ) 's exclamation, "I feel better, just
having talked about them."

    area hacking and resetting, this is always a potential problem.  I found to

    Perhaps this should be incorporated into the system in order to make it more

Maybe, although we're trying to phase out use of temporary areas and phase in
use of an efficient garbage collector.  It is probably hopeless to try to find
every last place that can be screwed by binding DEFAULT-CONS-AREA to a
temporary area.  I'm not opposed to fixing specific loopholes such as the two
you find, although I'm also completely unenthusiastic.

    In Release 5.1, Experimental MIT 1.4, Experimental 3D_Vision_system 1.0,
    FEP 18, on Lisp Machine Robot-3 (3600):

    The readline EOF option is not working.
    The documentation says that if EOF-OPTION is NIL, the second
    value returned is an EOF-FLAG. The flag is returned as NIL
    under normal circumstances but when the file runs out,
    READLINE only returns one value: NIL (the flag, which
    should then be t, isn't even there)

The 5.1 story: The documentation is completely wrong: READLINE returns
at most 2 arguments, not 4 as the documentation suggests.  The
documentation implies that the first argument is always a string.  The
code obviously disagrees; it returns NIL when at EOF.  The documentation
leaves the value of the second argument open for debate.  The EOF return
value is T only if the line was terminated by an EOF.  Since there was
no line, this condition can't hold.  I'll let you know (and send
bug-lmdoc mail if necessary) what the current development system thinks
of all this when I use it (the development system) next.

correctly.  The debugger consing in a bad area is indeed a piece of
unreliability.  It is documented that playing with temporary areas can
be dangerous.

In Release 5.1, Experimental MIT 1.4, Experimental IP-TCP 12.0, on Lisp Machine Tweety Pie (3600):

I frequently find that changes I make to cadr-15 can't be found because tv:edit-namespace-object
decides to read from polar rather than cadr-15 (even though cadr-15 responds to a finger
request).  Is there any way to force tv:edit-namespace-object to read from the primary namespace
server?

	We have had some problems with references to unallocated memory.  Since we do
	area hacking and resetting, this is always a potential problem.  I found to
	day that binding DEFAULT-CONS-AREA in the context of format and signal has,
	thusfar, (fingers crossed) eliminated these problems.

	(DEFUN DBG:SIGNAL (FLAVOR &REST INIT-OPTIONS)
	  (WITH-CONS-AREA SI:WORKING-STORAGE-AREA	;my macro should be in the system too
	    (SEND (DBG:GET-CONDITION FLAVOR INIT-OPTIONS) ':SIGNAL T)))

	(ADVISE FORMAT :AROUND NIL 0
	  (LET ((SI:DEFAULT-CONS-AREA SI:WORKING-STORAGE-AREA)) :DO-IT))

	Perhaps this should be incorporated into the system in order to make it more
	reliable for those who hack areas.

    Maybe, although we're trying to phase out use of temporary areas and phase in
    use of an efficient garbage collector.  It is probably hopeless to try to find
    every last place that can be screwed by binding DEFAULT-CONS-AREA to a
    temporary area.  I'm not opposed to fixing specific loopholes such as the two
    you find, although I'm also completely unenthusiastic.

Another way to lose less is to explicitly cons in your [JCMA's]
temporary area.  As you probably know, most constructors take an area
argument someplace.  This is often much safer than consing implicitly
(binding default-cons-area).  However, if you ever need a non-temporary
object, you have to copy it out and all internal pointers that point
into the temporary area.  Depending on your data structure and how much
you care about EQness, this may not be so bad.  In fact, you probably
have to worry about this already.

In Symbolics Release 4.5 on OU LIsp Machine Alan Turing:

The font option for an editor window in "Attributes" (in the system
menu) should allow one to change the current font. I have faked this in
some of my STANDALONE-EDITOR-WINDOWs using a :BEFORE :SET-CURRENT-FONT
method which forced an appropriate blip into the editor's input stream
but one would think there would be a more graceful strategy.

Novices here have complained that the current behavior (of letting you
change the font in the menu, but having that [a] have no visual effect
and [b] not even be remembered by the menu if called up again later) is
very confusing.

In Symbolics Release 4.5 on OU Lisp Machine Alan Turing:

Why is (:METHOD ZWEI:EDITOR :EDIT) such a big function, rather than
being broken up into message passes to SELF so it can be customized?

I have seen several people copy this whole message definition and make
little edits to it when it didn't seem like this was the right way for
them to do it (because they couldn't pick up modular patches, etc.).  I
almost had to do the same the other day but couldn't bear it, so found
another way to get the same end which was much more clumsy but which
didn't involve changing the editor.

For example, rather than doing REDISPLAY-ALL-WINDOWS, it should send itself
a :REDISPLAY-WINDOWS message. This would let custom editors redefine
the behavior or hook daemons off end-of-command redisplay.

Also, PROCESS-SPECIAL-COMMAND should be a per-editor message, not a
function, since different editors may want to accept different kind of
blips. At the very least, there should be a protocol for extending the
space of things that PROCESS-SPECIAL-COMMAND can do.  I recommend
something with :CASE method combination.

Actually, I think even PROCESS-COMMAND-CHAR should be a message pass on
the off chance that one ever had reason to make it work in some
different way.

Making these message passes also means they can be invoked from
an external process, rather than just the editor command loop,
which would also be handy.

I hope current trends (in Rel5) are toward such modularity.  I'm sorry
no Scientific Computing Customer Service person has seen fit to give us
a Rel5 in the two months since this machine was installed, or I'd just
check it out myself. I'm told that Rel5 is not available outside the US
(or at least inside the UK) yet. That's very sad; slows the wheels of
progress.

No. They were never set by anything.

I cannot check it against more recent software because I am in England

-kmp

Additional info which might be useful:

The files which were not set seemed to be files which were very recent.
Specifically, I suspect they were created within exactly 24 hours before I
began the dump. The directory was enormous and I didn't verify it across
the full dir, but this seemed to be true for the files I looked at
which did and didn't get their bits set.

I noted this because I was trying to figure out (in the absence of
documentation) what the Consolidated From date was about. My original
theory had been that perhaps it only dumped files for 6 days after the time
marked, but that seemed silly, which is why I am reporting this.


As I say, these are just my theories. I hope they are helpful.

    theory had been that perhaps it only dumped files for 6 days after the time

If you had the release 5 documentation, you could
look in the SITE section of Volume 8 for this info.
(Hurray!)  Since you don't have it, I'll quote the
relevant section for you:

    A @i(consolidated dump) is like an incremental dump,
    in that it only djmps files that have been created
    or changed recently.  When a consolidated dump is
    requested, a @i(consolidation date) is specified.  A
    consolidation date is always in the past.  The
    consolidated dump dumps only those files that have
    been created or changed since the consolidation
    date.  A consolidated dump is the appropriate kind
    to take if some event destroys recent incremental
    dump tapes, or they are found to be unreadable.

    doesn't seem to work in 5.1.  See bsg's comment in the source.

    >>Error: Invalid byte-size 16 for character mode in OPEN.

You are trying to use LM-2 technology for world
distribution on a 3600.  Do (MAKE-SYSTEM 'FEP-TAPE)
and (TAPE:WRITE-FEP-FILES-TO-TAPE).

It seems that the TAPE document only documents the wrong
way to do it, and nothing documents the right way.  This
was an oversight; FEP-TAPE was distributed with Release 5.0.
