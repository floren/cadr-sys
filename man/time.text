The 3time* package contains a set of functions for manipulating dates and
times: finding the current time, reading and printing dates and times,
converting between formats, and other miscellany regarding peculiarities
of the calendar system.  It also includes functions for accessing the
Lisp Machine's microsecond timer.

Times are represented in two different formats by the functions in the
3time* package.  One way is to represent a time by many numbers,
indicating a year, a month, a date, an hour, a minute, and a second
(plus, sometimes, a day of the week and timezone).  If a year less than
100 is specified, a multiple of 100 is added to it to bring it within
50 years of the present.  Year numbers returned by the
time functions are greater than 1900.  The month is 1 for January, 2 for
February, etc.  The date is 1 for the first day of a month.  The hour is
a number from 0 to 23.  The minute and second are numbers from 0 to 59.
Days of the week are fixnums, where 0 means Monday, 1 means Tuesday, and
so on.  A timezone is specified as the number of hours west of GMT; thus
in Massachusetts the timezone is 5.  Any adjustment for daylight savings
time is separate from this.

'cindex universal time
.setq universal-time page

This ``decoded'' format is convenient for printing out times into a readable
notation, but it is inconvenient for programs to make sense of these numbers
and pass them around as arguments (since there are so many of them).  So there
is a second representation, called Universal Time, which measures a time as the
number of seconds since January 1, 1900, at midnight GMT.  This ``encoded'' format
is easy to deal with inside programs, although it doesn't make much sense to
look at (it looks like a huge integer).  So both formats are provided; there are
functions to convert between the two formats; and many functions exist in two
versions, one for each format.

The Lisp Machine hardware includes a timer that counts once every
microsecond.  It is controlled by a crystal and so is fairly accurate.
The absolute value of this timer doesn't mean anything useful, since it
is initialized randomly; what you do with the timer is to read it at the
beginning and end of an interval, and subtract the two values to get the
length of the interval in microseconds.  These relative times allow you to time
intervals of up to an hour (32 bits) with microsecond accuracy.

The Lisp Machine keeps track of the time of day by maintaining a
2timebase*, using the microsecond clock to count off the seconds.
On the CADR, when the machine first comes up, the timebase is
initialized by querying hosts on the Chaosnet to find out the
current time.  The Lambda has a calendar clock which never stops,
so it normally does not need to do this.  You can also set the
time base using 3time:set-local-time*, described below.

There is a similar timer that counts in 60ths of a second rather than
microseconds; it is useful for measuring intervals of a few seconds or
minutes with less accuracy.  Periodic housekeeping functions of the system
are scheduled based on this timer.

.section Getting and Setting the Time

.defun get-decoded-time
.defun1 time:get-time
Gets the current time, in decoded form.  Return seconds, minutes, hours, date,
month, year, day-of-the-week, and daylight-savings-time-p, with the same
meanings as 3decode-universal-time* (see (decode-universal-time-fun)).
If the current time is not known, 3nil* is returned.

The name 3time:get-time* is obsolete.
.end_defun

.defun get-universal-time
Returns the current time in Universal Time form.
.end_defun

.defun time:set-local-time &optional new-time
Sets the local time to 2new-time*.  If 2new-time* is
supplied, it must be either a universal time or a suitable
argument to 3time:parse-universal-time* (see
(time:parse-universal-time-fun)).  If it is not supplied, or if
there is an error parsing the argument, you are prompted for the
new time.  Note that you will not normally need to call this
function; it is useful mainly when the timebase gets screwed up
for one reason or another.
.end_defun

.subsection Elapsed Time in 60ths of a Second
.cindex 60ths of a second

The following functions deal with a different kind of time.  These are not
calendrical date/times, but simply elapsed time in 60ths of a second.  These
times are used for many internal purposes where the idea is to measure a small
interval accurately, not to depend on the time of day or day of month.

.setq time-fun-1 page
.defun time
Returns a number that increases by 1 every 60th of a second.  The value
wraps around roughly once a day.  Use the 3time-lessp* and
3time-difference* functions to avoid getting in trouble due to the
wrap-around.  3time* is completely incompatible with the Maclisp
function of the same name.

Note that 3time* with an argument measures the length of time
required to evaluate a form.  See (time-fun-2).
.end_defun

.defun get-internal-run-time
.defun1 get-internal-real-time
Returns the total time in 60ths of a second since the last boot.
This value does not wrap around.  Eventually it becomes a bignum.
The Lisp Machine does not distinguish between run time and real time.
.end_defun

.defconst internal-time-units-per-second
According to Common Lisp, this is the ratio between a second and the
time unit used by values of 3get-internal-real-time*.  On the Lisp
Machine, the value is 60.  The value may be different in other Common
Lisp implementations.
.end_defconst

.defun time-lessp time1 time2
3t* if 2time1* is earlier than 2time2*, compensating for
wrap-around, otherwise 3nil*.
.end_defun

.defun time-difference time1 time2
Assuming 2time1* is later than 2time2*, returns the number of 60ths
of a second difference between them, compensating for wrap-around.
.end_defun

.defun time-increment time interval
Increments 2time* by 2interval*, wrapping around if appropriate.
.end_defun

.subsection Elapsed Time in Microseconds
.cindex microseconds

.defun time:microsecond-time
Returns the value of the microsecond timer, as a bignum.  The values
returned by this function wrap around back to zero about once per hour.
.end_defun

.defun time:fixnum-microsecond-time
Returns as a fixnum the value of the low 23 bits of the microsecond timer.
This is like 3time:microsecond-time*, with the advantage that
it returns a value in the same format as the 3time* function, except
in microseconds rather than 60ths of a second.  This means that you can
compare fixnum-microsecond-times with 3time-lessp* and
3time-difference*.  3time:fixnum-microsecond-time* is also a bit
faster, but has the disadvantage that since you only see the low bits of
the clock, the value can wrap around more quickly (about every eight seconds).
Note that the Lisp Machine garbage collector is so designed that the
bignums produced by 3time:microsecond-time* are garbage-collected
quickly and efficiently, so the overhead for creating the bignums is
really not high.
.end_defun

.section Printing Dates and Times

The functions in this section create printed representations of times and
dates in various formats and send the characters to a stream.  To any
of these functions, you may pass 3nil* as the 2stream* parameter
and the function will return a string containing the printed representation
of the time, instead of printing the characters to any stream.

The three functions 3time:print-time*,
3time:print-universal-time*,
3time:print-brief-universal-time* and
3time:print-current-time* accept an argument called
2date-print-mode*, whose purpose is to control how the date is
printed.  It always defaults to the value of
3time:*default-date-print-mode**.  Possible values include:
.table 3 0 1200
.item :dd//mm//yy
Print the date as in `3/16/53'.
.item :mm//dd//yy
Print as in `16/3/53'.
.item :dd-mm-yy
Print as in `16-3-53'.
.item :dd-mmm-yy
Print as in `16-Mar-53'.
.item :|dd mmm yy|
Print as in `16 Mar 53'.
.item :ddmmmyy
Print as in `16Mar53'.
.item :yymmdd
Print as in `530316'.
.item :yymmmdd
Print as in `53Mar16'.
.end_table

.defun time:print-current-time &optional (stream 3*standard-output**)
Prints the current time, formatted as in 311/25/80 14:50:02*, to
the specified stream.  The date portion may be printed differently
according to the argument 2date-print-mode*.
.end_defun

.defun time:print-time seconds minutes hours date month year &optional (stream 3*standard-output**) date-print-mode
Prints the specified time, formatted as in 311/25/80 14:50:02*, to
the specified stream.  The date portion may be printed differently
according to the argument 2date-print-mode*.
.end_defun

.defun time:print-universal-time universal-time &optional (stream 3*standard-output**) (timezone 3time:*timezone**) date-print-mode
Prints the specified time, formatted as in 311/25/80 14:50:02*, to the specified stream.  The date portion may be printed differently
according to the argument 2date-print-mode*.
.end_defun

.defun time:print-brief-universal-time universal-time &optional (stream 3*standard-output**) reference-time date-print-mode
This is like 3time:print-universal-time* except that it omits seconds and
only prints those parts of 2universal-time* that differ from
2reference-time*, a universal time that defaults to the current time.
Thus the output is in one of the following three forms:
.lisp
02:59		;1the same day*
3/4 14:01	;1a different day in the same year*
8/17/74 15:30	;1a different year*
.end_lisp

The date portion may be printed differently
according to the argument 2date-print-mode*.
.end_defun

.defvar time:*default-date-print-mode*
Holds the default for the 2date-print-mode* argument to each
of the functions above.  Initially the value here is 3:mm//dd/yy*.
.end_defvar

.defun time:print-current-date &optional (stream 3*standard-output**)
Prints the current time, formatted as in 3Tuesday the twenty-fifth of
November, 1980; 3:50:41 pm*, to the specified stream. 
.end_defun

.defun time:print-date seconds minutes hours date month year day-of-the-week &optional (stream 3*standard-output**)
Prints the specified time, formatted as in 3Tuesday the twenty-fifth of
November, 1980; 3:50:41 pm*, to the specified stream.
.end_defun

.defun time:print-universal-date universal-time &optional (stream 3*standard-output**) (timezone 3time:*timezone**)
Prints the specified time, formatted as in 3Tuesday the twenty-fifth of
November, 1980; 3:50:41 pm*, to the specified stream.
.end_defun

.section Reading Dates and Times

These functions accept most reasonable printed representations of date and time
and convert them to the standard internal forms.  The following are
representative formats that are accepted by the parser.  Note that
slashes are escaped with additional slashes, as is necessary if
these strings are input in traditional syntax.

.lisp
"March 15, 1960"      "3//15//60"   "3//15//1960"
"15 March 1960"       "15//3//60"   "15//3//1960"
"March-15-60"         "3-15-60"     "3-15-1960"
"15-March-60"         "15-3-60"     "15-3-1960"
"15-Mar-60"           "3-15"        "15 March 60"
"Fifteen March 60"    "The Fifteenth of March, 1960;"
"Friday, March 15, 1980"

"1130."     "11:30"     "11:30:17"  "11:30 pm"
"11:30 AM"  "1130"      "113000"
"11.30"     "11.30.00"  "11.3"      "11 pm"

"12 noon"   "midnight"  "m"    "6:00 gmt"  "3:00 pdt"

   1any date format may be used with any time format*

"One minute after March 3, 1960"
   1meaning one minute after midnight*
"Two days after March 3, 1960"
"Three minutes after 23:59:59 Dec 31, 1959"

"Now"     "Today"     "Yesterday"   "five days ago"
"two days after tomorrow"   "the day after tomorrow"         
"one day before yesterday"  "BOB@OZ's birthday"
.end_lisp

.defun time:parse string &optional (start 30*) (end 3nil*) (futurep 3t*) base-time must-have-time date-must-have-year time-must-have-second (day-must-be-valid 3t*)
Interpret 2string* as a date and/or time, and return seconds, minutes,
hours, date, month, year, day-of-the-week, daylight-savings-time-p, and relative-p.
2start* and 2end* delimit a substring
of the string; if 2end* is 3nil*, the end of the string is used.
2must-have-time* means that 2string* must not be empty.
2date-must-have-year* means that a year must be explicitly specified.
2time-must-have-second* means that the second must be specified.
2day-must-be-valid* means that if a day of the week is given, then it
must actually be the day that corresponds to the date.  2base-time* provides
the defaults for unspecified components; if it is 3nil*, the current time
is used.  2futurep* means that the time should be interpreted as being
in the future; for example, if the base time is 5:00 and the string refers
to the time 3:00, that means the next day if 2futurep* is non-3nil*, but
it means two hours ago if 2futurep* is 3nil*.  The 2relative-p*
returned value is 3t* if the string included a relative part, such
as `one minute after' or `two days before' or `tomorrow' or `now'; otherwise,
it is 3nil*.

If the input is not valid, the error condition 3sys:parse-error*
is signaled (see (sys:parse-error-condition)).
.end_defun

.defun time:parse-universal-time string &optional (start 30*) (end 3nil*) (futurep 3t*) base-time must-have-time date-must-have-year time-must-have-second (day-must-be-valid 3t*)
This is the same as 3time:parse* except that it returns two
values: an integer, representing the time in Universal Time, and
the 2relative-p* value.
.end_defun

.section Reading and Printing Time Intervals

In addition to the functions for reading and printing instants of time,
there are other functions specifically for printing time intervals.  A
time interval is either a number (measured in seconds) or 3nil*,
meaning `never'.  The printed representations used look like `3 minutes
23 seconds' for actual intervals, or `Never' for 3nil* (some other
synonyms and abbreviations for `never' are accepted as input).

.defun time:print-interval-or-never interval &optional (stream 3*standard-output**)
2interval* should be a non-negative fixnum or 3nil*.
Its printed representation as a time interval is written onto
2stream*.
.end_defun

.defun time:parse-interval-or-never string &optional start end
Converts 2string*, a printed representation for a time interval, into
a number or 2nil*.  2start* and 2end* may be used to specify a
portion of 2string* to be used; the default is to use all of
2string*.  It is an error if the contents of string do not look like a
reasonable time interval.  Here are some examples of acceptable strings:

.lisp
"4 seconds"       "4 secs"          "4 s"
"5 mins 23 secs"  "5 m 23 s"        "23 SECONDS 5 M"
           "3 yrs 1 week 1 hr 2 mins 1 sec"
"never"           "not ever"        "no"              ""
.end_lisp

Note that several abbreviations are understood, the components may be in
any order, and case (upper versus lower) is ignored.  Also, ``months'' are
not recognized, since various months have different lengths and there is
no way to know which month is being spoken of.  This function
always accepts anything that was produced by 3time:print-interval-or-never*;
furthermore, it returns exactly the same fixnum (or 3nil*) that
was printed.
.end_defun

.defun time:read-interval-or-never &optional (stream 3*standard-input**)
Reads a line of input from 2stream* (using 3readline*) and
then calls 3time:parse-interval-or-never* on the resulting string.
.end_defun

.section Time Conversions

.defun decode-universal-time universal-time &optional (timezone 3time:*timezone**)
Converts 2universal-time* into its decoded representation.  The
following values are returned: seconds, minutes, hours, date, month,
year, day-of-the-week, daylight-savings-time-p, and the timezone used.
2daylight-savings-time-p* tells you whether or not
daylight savings time is in effect; if so, the value of 2hour* has been
adjusted accordingly.  You can specify 2timezone* explicitly if you
want to know the equivalent representation for this time in other parts
of the world.
.end_defun

.defun encode-universal-time seconds minutes hours date month year &optional timezone
Converts the decoded time into Universal Time format, and return the
Universal Time as an integer.  If you don't specify 2timezone*, it
defaults to the current timezone adjusted for daylight savings time; if
you provide it explicitly, it is not adjusted for daylight savings time.
If 2year* is less than 100, it is shifted by centuries until it is
within 50 years of the present.
.end_defun

.defvar time:*timezone*
The value of 3time:*timezone** is the time zone in which this Lisp Machine
resides, expressed in terms of the number of hours west of GMT this time
zone is.  This value does not change to reflect daylight savings time; it
tells you about standard time in your part of the world.
.end_defvar

.section Internal Functions

These functions provide support for those listed above.  Some user programs
may need to call them directly, so they are documented here.

.defun time:initialize-timebase
Initializes the timebase by querying Chaosnet hosts to find out the
current time.  This is called automatically during system initialization.
You may want to call it yourself to correct the time if it appears to be
inaccurate or downright wrong.  See also 3time:set-local-time*,
(time:set-local-time-fun).
.end_defun

.defun time:daylight-savings-time-p hours date month year
Returns 3t* if daylight savings time is in effect for the specified
hour; otherwise, return 3nil*. 
If 2year* is less than 100, it is shifted by centuries until it is
within 50 years of the present.
.end_defun

.defun time:daylight-savings-p
Returns 3t* if daylight savings time is currently in effect; otherwise,
returns 3nil*.
.end_defun

.defun time:month-length month year
Returns the number of days in the specified 2month*; you must supply
a 2year* in case the month is February (which has a different length
during leap years).
If 2year* is less than 100, it is shifted by centuries until it is
within 50 years of the present.
.end_defun

.defun time:leap-year-p year
Returns 3t* if 2year* is a leap year; otherwise return 3nil*.
If 2year* is less than 100, it is shifted by centuries until it is
within 50 years of the present.
.end_defun

.defun time:verify-date date month year day-of-the-week
If the day of the week of the date specified by 2date*, 2month*, and
2year* is the same as 2day-of-the-week*, returns 3nil*; otherwise,
returns a string that contains a suitable error message.
If 2year* is less than 100, it is shifted by centuries until it is
within 50 years of the present.
.end_defun

.defun time:day-of-the-week-string day-of-the-week &optional (mode 3:long*)
Returns a string representing the day of the week.  As usual, 30* means
Monday, 31* means Tuesday, and so on.  Possible values of 2mode*
are:
.table 3
.kitem :long
Returns the full English name, such as 3"Monday"*, 3"Tuesday"*, etc.  This
is the default.
.kitem :short
Returns a three-letter abbreviation, such as 3"Mon"*, 3"Tue"*, etc.
.kitem :medium
Returns a longer abbreviation, such as 3"Tues"* and 3"Thurs"*.
.kitem :french
Returns the French name, such as 3"Lundi"*, 3"Mardi"*, etc.
.kitem :german
Returns the German name, such as 3"Montag"*, 3"Dienstag"*, etc.
.kitem :italian
Returns the Italian name, such as 3"Lunedi"*, 3"Martedi"*, etc.
.end_table
.end_defun

.defun time:month-string month &optional (mode 3:long*)
Returns a string representing the month of the year.  As usual, 31* means January,
32* means February, etc.  Possible values of 2mode* are:
.table 3
.kitem :long
Returns the full English name, such as 3"January"*, 3"February"*, etc.  This
is the default.
.kitem :short
Returns a three-letter abbreviation, such as 3"Jan"*, 3"Feb"*, etc.
.kitem :medium
Returns a longer abbreviation, such as 3"Sept"*, 3"Novem"*, and 3"Decem"*.
.kitem :roman
Returns the Roman numeral for 2month* (this convention is used in Europe).
.kitem :french
Returns the French name, such as 3"Janvier"*, 3"Fevrier"*, etc.
.kitem :german
Returns the German name, such as 3"Januar"*, 3"Februar"*, etc.
.kitem :italian
Returns the Italian name, such as 3"Gennaio"*, 3"Febbraio"*, etc.
.end_table
.end_defun

.defun time:timezone-string &optional (timezone 3time:*timezone**) (daylight-savings-p 3(time:daylight-savings-p)*)
Return the three-letter abbreviation for this time zone.  For example, if
2timezone* is 35*, then either 3"EST"* (Eastern Standard Time) or 3"CDT"*
(Central Daylight Time) is used, depending on 2daylight-savings-p*.
.end_defun
