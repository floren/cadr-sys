.chapter Miscellaneous Useful Functions
.setq misc-chapter chapter-number

This chapter describes a number of functions that don't logically fit in anywhere else.
Most of these functions are not normally used in programs, but are ``commands'', i.e.
things that you type directly at Lisp.

.section Documentation

.defun documentation name doc-type
Returns the documentation string of 2name* in the role 2doc-type*.
2doc-type* should be a symbol, but only its print-name matters.
3function* as 2doc-type* requests the documentation of 2name*
as a function, 3variable* as 2doc-type* requests the documentation of
2name* as a variable, and so on.

When 2doc-type* is 3function*, 2name* can be any function spec,
and the documentation string of its function definition is returned.
Otherwise, 2name* must be a symbol, and 2doc-type* may be anything.
However, only these values of 2doc-type* are standardly used:
.table 3
.item variable
Documentation of 2name* as a special variable.  Such documentation is
recorded automatically by 3defvar*, 3defconst*, 3defconstant*,
3defparameter* ((defvar-fun)).
.item type
Documentation of 2name* as a type for 3typep*.  Recorded
automatically when a documentation string is given in a 3deftype*
form ((deftype-fun)).
.item structure
Documentation of 2name* as a 3defstruct* type.
Recorded automatically by a 3defstruct* for 2name* ((defstruct)).
.item setf
Documentation on what it means to 3setf* a form
that starts with 2name*.
Recorded when there is a documentation string in a 3defsetf* of 2name*
((defsetf-fun)).
.item flavor
Documentation of the flavor named 2name*.
Put on by the 3:documentation* option in a 3defflavor* for 2name*
((defflavor-fun)).
.item resource
Documentation of the resource named 2name*.
Put on when there is a documentation string in a 3defresource* of 2name*
((defresource-fun)).
.item signal
Documentation for 2name* as a signal name.
Put on when there is a documentation string in a 3defsignal* or 3defsignal-explicit*
for 2name* ((defsignal-fun)).
.end_table

Documentation strings for any 2doc-type* can be added to 2name*
by doing 3(setf (documentation 2name* 2doc-type*) 2string*)*.
.end_defun

The command 3Control-Shift-D* in Zmacs and the rubout handler, used
within a call to a function, prints the documentation of that function.
3Control-Shift-V*, within a symbol, prints the documentation of that
symbol as a variable.

.section Hardcopy
.setq hardcopy section-page

The hardcopy functions allow you to specify the printer to use on each
call.  The default is set up by the site files for your site, but can be
overridden for a particular machine in the 3LMLOCS* file or by a user
in his INIT file.  Any kind of printer can be used, no matter how it is
actually driven, if it is hooked into the software properly as described below.

A 2printer-type* is a keyword that has appropriate properties;
a 2printer* is either a printer-type or a list starting with one.
The rest of the list can specify 2which* printer of that type you want
to use (perhaps with a host name or filename).

The printer types defined by the system are:
.table
.xitem :dover printer-type
This printer type is used by itself as a printer, and refers to the
Dover at MIT.

.xitem :xgp printer-type
This printer type indicates a printer that is accessed by writing spool
files in MIT XGP format.  A printer would be specified as a list,
3(:xgp 2filename*)*, specifying where to write the spool file.

.xitem :press-file printer-type
This printer type is used in a list together with a file name, as in
3(:press-file "OZ:<RMS>FOO.PRESS")*.  Something is ``printed'' on such
a printer by being converted to a press file and written under that
name.
.end_table

.defun hardcopy-file filename &rest options
Print the file 2filename* in hard copy on the specified printer or the
default printer.  2options* is a list of keyword argument names and
values.  There are only two keywords that are always meaningful:
3:format* and 3:printer*.  Everything else is up to the individual
printer to interpret.  The list here is only a paradigm or suggestion.

.table 3
.kitem :printer
The value is the printer to use.  The default is the value of
3si:*default-printer**.

.kitem :format
The value is a keyword that specifies the format of file to be parsed.
The standard possibilities are 3:text* (an ordinary file of text),
3:xgp* (a file of the sort once used by the XGP at MIT), 3:press* (a
Xerox-style press file) and 3:suds-plot* (a file produced by the
Stanford drawing program).  However, each kind of printer may define its
own format keywords.

.kitem :font
.xitem :font-list hardcopy-file
The value of 2font* is the name of a font to print the file in (a
string).  Alternatively, you can give 3:font-list* and specify a list
of such font names, for use if the file contains font-change commands.
The interpretation of a font name is dependent on the printer being
used.  There is no necessary relation to Lisp machine display fonts.
However, printers are encouraged to use, by default, fonts that are
similar in appearance to the Lisp machine fonts listed in the file's
attribute list, if it is a text file.

.kitem :heading-font
The value is the name of the font for use in page headers, if there are
any.

.kitem :vsp
The value is the extra spacing to use between lines, in over and beyond
the height of the fonts.

.kitem :page-headings
If the value is non-3nil*, a heading is added to each page.

.kitem :copies
The value is the number of copies to print.

.kitem :spool
If the printer provides optional spooling, this argument says whether to
spool (default is 3nil*).  Some printers may intrinsically always
spool; others may have no way to spool.
.end_table
.end_defun

.defun set-printer-default-option printer-type option value
Sets a default for 2option* for printers of type
2printer-type*.  Any use of the hardcopy functions
with a printer of that type and no value specified for 2option*
will use the value 2value*.  For example,
.lisp
(set-printer-default-option :dover :spool t)
.end_lisp
causes output to Dover printers to be spooled unless the
3:spool* option is explicitly specified with value 3nil*.

Currently defaultable options are 3:font*, 3:font-list*,
3:heading-font*, 3:page-headings*, 3:vsp*, 3:copies*, and
3:spool*.
.end_defun

.defun hardcopy-stream stream &rest options
Like 3hardcopy-file* but uses the text read from 2stream* rather
than opening a file.  The 3:format* option is not allowed (since
implementing it requires the ability to open the file with unusual
3open* options).
.end_defun

.defun hardcopy-bit-array array left top right bottom &rest options
Print all or part of the bit-array 2array* on the specified or default
printer.  2options* is a list of keyword argument names and values;
the only standard option is 3:printer*, which specifies the printer to
use.  The default printer is 3si:*default-bit-array-printer**, or, if
that is 3nil*, 3si:*default-printer*.

2left*, 2top*, 2right* and 2bottom* specify the subrectangle of
the array to be printed.  All four numbers measure from the top left
corner (which is element 0, 0).
.end_defun

.defun hardcopy-status &optional printer (stream 3*standard-output**)
Prints the status of 2printer*, or the default printer.
This should include if possible such things as whether the printer has
paper and what is in the queue.
.end_defun

.defvar si:*default-printer*
This is the default printer.  It is set from the 3:default-printer*
site option.
.end_defvar

.defvar si:*default-bit-array-printer*
If non-3nil*, this is the default printer for printing bit arrays,
overriding 3si:*default-printer**.  A separate default is provided for
bit arrays since some printers that can print files cannot print bit
arrays.  This variable is set initially from the
3:default-bit-array-printer* site option.
.end_defvar

.need 1500
.nopara
Defining a printer type:

A printer type is any keyword that has suitable functions on the
appropriate properties.

To be used with the function 3hardcopy-file*, the printer type must
have a 3si:print-file* property.  To be used with 3hardcopy-stream*,
the printer type must have a 3si:print-stream* property.
3hardcopy-bit-array* uses the 3si:print-bit-array* property.
3hardcopy-status* uses the 3si:print-status* property.
(The hardcopy functions' names are not themselves used simply to avoid
using a symbol in the global package as a property name of a symbol
that might be in the global package as well).

Each property, to be used, should be a function whose first argument
will be the printer and whose remaining arguments will fit the same
pattern as those of the hardcopy function the user called.  (They will
not necessarily be the same arguments, as some additional keywords may be
added to the list of keyword arguments; but they will fit the same
description.)

For example,
.lisp
(hardcopy-file "foo" :printer '(:press-file "bar.press"))
.end_lisp
results in the execution of
.lisp
(funcall (get :press-file 'si:print-file)
         '(:press-file "bar.press")
	 "foo" :printer '(:press-file "bar.press"))
.end_lisp

A printer type need not support operations that make no sense on it.
For example, there is no 3si:print-status* property on
3:press-file*.

.section Metering
.setq meter-section section-page

The metering system is a way of finding out what parts of your program
use up the most time.  When you run your program with metering, every
function call and return is recorded, together with the time at which it
took place.  Page faults are also recorded.  Afterward, the metering
system analyzes the records and tells you how much time was spent
executing withain each function.  Because the records are stored in the disk
partition called 3METR*, there is room for a lot of data.

Before you meter a program, you must enable metering in some or all
stack groups.  3meter:enable* is used for this.  Then you evaluate one
or more forms with metering, perhaps by using 3meter:test* or
3meter:run*.  Finally, you use 3meter:analyze* to summarize and
print the metering data.

There are two parameters that control whether metering data are
recorded.  First of all, the variable 3sys:%meter-microcode-enables*
contains bits that enable recording of various kinds of events.  Secondly,
each stack group has a flag that controls whether events are recorded
while running in that stack group.

.defvar sys:%meter-microcode-enables
Enables recording of metering data.
Each bit controls recording of one kind of event.
.table 3
.item 1
This bit enables recording of page faults.
.item 2
This bit enables recording of consing.
.item 4
This bit enables recording of function entry and exit.
.item 8
This bit enables recording of stack group switching.
.end_table

The value is normally zero, which turns off all recording.
.end_defvar

.need 1500
.nopara
These are the functions used to control which stack groups do metering:

.defun meter:enable &rest things
Enables metering in the stack groups specified by 2things*.
Each thing in 2things* may be a stack group, a process (which
specifies the process's stack group), or a window (which specifies the
window's process's stack group).  3t* is also allowed.  It enables
metering in all stack groups.
.end_defun

.defun meter:disable &rest things
Disables metering in the stack groups specified by 2things*.
The arguments allowed are the same as for 3meter:enable*.
3(meter:disable t)* turns off 3(meter:enable t)*, but does not
disable stack groups enabled individually.  3(meter:disable)* disables
all stack groups no matter how you specified to enable them.
.end_defun

.defvar meter:metered-objects
This is a list of all the 2things* you have enabled with
3meter:enable* and not disabled.
.end_defvar

.need 1500
.nopara
These are the functions to evaluate forms with metering:

.defun meter:run forms
Clears out the metering data and evaluates the 2forms* with
3sys:%meter-microcode-enables* bound to 14 octal (record function
entry and exit, and stack group switching).  Any of the evaluation that
takes place in enabled stack groups will record metering data.
.end_defun

.defun meter:test form (enables 3#o14*)
Clears out the metering data, enables metering for the current
stack group only, and evaluates 2form* with
3sys:%meter-microcode-enables* bound to 2enables*.
.end_defun

.need 1500
.nopara
This is how you print the results:

.defun meter:analyze &key analyzer stream file buffer return info &allow-other-keys
Analyzes the data recorded by metering.
2analyzer* is a keyword specifies a kind of analysis.  3:tree*
is the default.  Another useful alternative is 3:list-events*.
Particular analyzers handle other keyword arguments in addition
to those listed above.

The output is printed on 2stream*, written to a file named
2file*, or put in an editor buffer named 2buffer* (at most one of
these three arguments should be specified).  The default is to print on
3*standard-output**.

Analyzing the metering data involves creating a large intermediate data
base.  Normally this is created afresh each time 3meter:analyze* is
called.  If you specify a non-3nil* value for 2return*, the
intermediate data structure is returned by 3meter:analyze*, and can be
passed in on another call as the 2info* argument.  This can save time.
But you can only do this if you use the same 2analyzer* each time,
as different analyzers use different termporary data structures.
.end_defun

The default analyzer 3:tree* prints out the amount of run time and
real time spent executing each function that was called.  The real time
includes time spend waiting and time spent writing metering data to disk;
for computational tasks, the latter makes the real time less useful
than the run time.
3:tree* handles these additional keyword arguments to 3meter:analyze*:
.table 3
.xitem :find-callers "meter:analyze"
The argument for this keyword is a function spec or a list of function specs.
A list of who called the specified functions,
and how often, is printed instead of the usual output.

.xitem :stack-group "meter:analyze"
The argument is a stack group or a list of them;
only the activities in those stack groups are printed.

.xitem :sort-function "meter:analyze"
The argument is the name of a suitable sorting function that is used to
sort the items for the various functions that were called.  Sorting
functions provided include 3meter:max-page-faults*,
3meter:max-calls*, 3meter:max-run-time* (the default),
3meter:max-real-time*, and 3meter:max-run-time-per-call*.

.xitem :summarize "meter:analyze"
The argument is a function spec or a list of function specs;
only those functions' statistics are printed.

.xitem :inclusive "meter:analyze"
If this is non-3nil*, the times for each function include
the time spent in executing subroutines called from the function.

Note: if a function is called recursively, the time spent in the inner
call(s) is counted twice (or more).
.end_table

The analyzer 3:list-events* prints out one line about each event
recorded.  The line contains the run time and real time (in
microseconds), the running count of page faults, the stack group name,
the function that was running, the stack depth, the type of event, and a
piece of data.  For example:

.lisp
   0   0    0 ZMACS-WINDOWS  METER:TEST   202 CALL SI:EVAL
 115  43    0 ZMACS-WINDOWS  METER:TEST   202 RET  SI:EVAL
 180  87    0 ZMACS-WINDOWS  METER:TEST   202 RET  CATCH

real run   pf  stack-group    function  stack event data
time time                               level type
.end_lisp

3:list-events* is often useful with recording of page faults
(3sys:%meter-microcode-enables* set to 1).

.defun meter:reset
Clears out all metering data.
.end_defun

Because metering records pointers to Lisp objects in a disk partition
which is not part of the Lisp address space, garbage collection is
inhibited (by arresting the gc process) when you turn on metering.

.defun meter:resume-gc-process
Allows garbage collection to continue (if it is already turned on) by
unarresting it.
.end_defun

.section Poking Around in the Lisp World

.defun who-calls x &optional package (inheritors 3t*) (inherited 3t*)
2x* must be a symbol or a list of symbols.
3who-calls* tries
to find all of the functions in the Lisp world
that call 2x* as a function, use 2x* as a variable,
or use 2x* as a constant.  (Constants which are lists
containing 2x* are not found.)  It tries to find all of the functions
by searching all of the function cells of
all of the symbols in 2package* and packages that inherit
from 2package* (unless 2inheritors* is 3nil*) and packages
2package* inherits from (unless 2inherited* is 3nil*).
2package* defaults to the 3global* package, which means that
all normal packages are checked.

If 3who-calls* encounters an interpreted function definition, it
simply tells you if 2x* appears anywhere in the interpreted code.
3who-calls* is smarter about compiled code, since it has been
nicely predigested by the compiler.  Macros expanded in the compilation
of the code can be found because they are recorded in the caller's
debugging info alist, even though they are not actually referred to
by the compiled code.

If 2x* is a list of symbols, 3who-calls* does them all simultaneously,
which is faster than doing them one at a time.

3who-uses* is an obsolete name for 3who-calls*.

The editor has a command,3 Meta-X List Callers*, which is similar to 3who-calls*.

The symbol 3:unbound-function* is treated specially by 3who-calls*.
3(who-calls :unbound-function)* searches all the compiled
code for any calls through a symbol that is not currently
defined as a function.  This is useful for finding errors such
as functions you misspelled the names of or forgot to write.

3who-calls* prints one line of information for each caller it finds.  It also
returns a list of the names of all the callers.
.end_defun

.defun what-files-call x &optional package (inheritors 3t*) (inherited 3t*)
Similar to 3who-calls* but returns a list of the pathnames of all the files
that contain functions that 3who-calls* would have printed out.  This is useful
if you need to recompile and/or edit all of those files.
.end_defun

.defun apropos substring &optional package &key (inheritors 3t*) inherited dont-print predicate boundp fboundp
3(apropos 2substring*)* tries to find all symbols whose print-names
contain 2substring* as a substring.  Whenever it finds a symbol, it
prints out the symbol's name; if the symbol is defined as a function
and/or bound to a value, it tells you so and prints the names of the
arguments (if any) to the function.

If 2predicate* is non-3nil*, it should be a function; only symbols
on which the function returns non-3nil* are counted.  In addition, 2fboundp*
non-3nil* means only symbols with function definitions are considered,
and 2boundp* non-3nil* means that only symbols with values are considered.

3apropos* looks for symbols on 2package*, and all packages that use
2package* (unless 2inheritors* is 3nil*).  If 2inherited* is
non-3nil*, all packages used by 2package* are searched as well.
2package* can be a package or a symbol or string naming a package.  It
can also be a list of packages, symbols and strings; all of the packages
thus specified are searched.  2package* defaults to a list of all
packages except invisible ones.

3apropos* returns a list of all the symbols it finds.
If 2dont-print* is non-3nil*, that is all it does.
.end_defun

.defun sub-apropos substring starting-list &key predicate dont-print
Finds all symbols in 2starting-list* whose names contain
2substring*, and that satisfy 2predicate*.  If 2predicate* is
3nil*, the substring is the only condition.  The symbols are printed
if 2dont-print* is 3nil*.  A list of the symbols found is returned,
in any case.

This function is most useful when applied to the value of 7**, after
3apropos* has returned a long list.
.end_defun

.defun where-is pname &optional package
Prints the names of all packages that contain a symbol with the
print-name 2pname*.  If 2pname* is a string it gets upper-cased.
The package 2package* and all packages that inherit from it are
searched.  2package* can be a package or the name of a package, or a
list of packages and names.  It defaults to a list of all packages
except invisible ones.  3where-is* returns a list of all the symbols
it finds.
.end_defun

.defun describe x
3describe* tries to tell you all of the interesting information
about any object 2x* (except for array contents).  3describe* knows
about arrays, symbols, floats, packages, stack groups, closures, and FEFs, and prints
out the attributes of each in human-readable form.  Sometimes
objects found inside 2x* are described also;
such recursive descriptions are indented appropriately.  For instance,
3describe* of a symbol also describes the symbol's value,
its definition, and each of its properties.  3describe* of a float
(full-size or short) shows you its internal representation in a way
that is useful for tracking down roundoff errors and the like.

If 2x* is a named-structure, 3describe* invokes the 3:describe*
operation to print the description, if that is supported.
To understand this, you should read the section on named structures
(see (named-structure)).  If the 3:describe* operation is not
supported, 3describe* looks on the named-structure symbol for information
that might have been left by 3defstruct*; this information would
tell it what the symbolic names for the entries in the structure are,
and 3describe* knows how to use the names to print out what each field's
name and contents is.

3describe* of an instance always invokes the 3:describe* operation.
All flavors support it, since 3si:vanilla-flavor* defines a method for it.

3describe* always returns its argument, in case you want to do something else to it.
.end_defun

.defun inspect x
A window-oriented version of 3describe*.  See the window system documentation
for details, or try it and type 3Help*.
.end_defun

.defun disassemble function
Prints out a human-readable version of the macro-instructions in
2function*.  2function* should be a FEF, or a function spec whose
definition is a FEF.  The macro-code instruction set is explained in
(macro-code).
.end_defun

.nopara
The 3grindef* function (see (grindef-fun)) may be used to display the definition
of a non-compiled function.

.defun room &rest areas
Prints a summary of memory usage.

The first line of output tells you the amount of physical memory on the
machine, the amount of available virtual memory not yet filled with data
(that is, the portion of the available virtual memory that has not yet
been allocated to any region of any area), and the amount of wired
physical memory (i.e. memory not available for paging). 

Following lines tell you how much room is left in some areas.  For each
area it tells you about, it prints out the name of the area, the number
of regions that currently make up the area, the current size of the area in kilowords,
and the amount of the area that has been allocated, also in kilowords.
If the area cannot grow, the percentage that is free is displayed.

3(room)* tells you about those areas that are in the list that is the value
of the variable 3room*.  These are the most interesting ones.

3(room 2area1* 2area2*...)* tells you about those areas, which can
be either the names or the numbers.

3(room t)* tells you about all the areas.

3(room nil)* does not tell you about any areas; it only prints the
first line of output.
.end_defun

.defvar room
The value of 3room* is a list of area names and/or area numbers,
denoting the areas that the function 3room* should describe if given
no arguments.  Its initial value is:
.lisp
(working-storage-area macro-compiled-program)
.end_lisp
.end_defvar


.section Utility Programs

.defun ed &optional x
3ed* is the main function for getting into the editor, Zmacs.
The commands of Zmacs are very similar to those of Emacs.

3(ed)* or 3(ed nil)* simply enters the editor, leaving you in the same
buffer as the last time you were in the editor.  It has the same effect
as typing 3System E*.

3(ed t)* puts you in a fresh buffer with a generated name (like BUFFER-4).

3(ed 2pathname*)* edits that file.  2pathname* may be an actual pathname
or a string.

3(ed 'foo)* tries hard to edit the definition of the 3foo* function.
It can find a buffer or file containing the source code for 3foo*
and position the cursor at the beginning of the code.  In general, 3foo*
can be any function-spec (see (function-spec)).

3(ed 'zwei:reload)* reinitializes the editor.  It forgets about all
existing buffers, so use this only as a last resort.
.end_defun

.defun zwei:save-all-files
This function is useful in emergencies in which you have modified material
in Zmacs buffers that needs to be saved, but the editor is partially broken.
This function does what the editor's 3Save All Files* command does, but
it stays away from redisplay and other advanced facilities so that
it might work if other things are broken.
.end_defun

.defun dired &optional pathname
Puts up a window and edits the directory named by 2pathname*, which
defaults to the last file opened.  While editing a directory you may
view, edit, compare, hardcopy, and delete the files and subdirectories
it contains.  While in the directory editor type the 3Help* key for
further information.
.end_defun

.defun mail &optional user text call-editor-anyway
Sends the string 2text* as mail to 2user*.  2user* should also be
a string, of the form 3"2username7@*hostname*"*.  Multiple
recipients separated by commas are also allowed.

If you do not provide two arguments, 3mail* puts up an editor window
in which you may compose the mail.  Type the 3End* key to send the
mail and return from the 3mail* function.

The window is also used if 2call-editor-anyway* is non-3nil*.
.end_defun

.defun bug &optional topic text call-editor-anyway
Reports a bug.  2topic* is the name of the faulty program (a symbol or
a string).  It defaults to 3lispm* (the Lisp Machine system itself).
2text* is a string which contains the information to report.  If you
do not provide two arguments, or if 2call-editor-anyway* is
non-3nil*, a window is put up for you to compose the mail.

3bug* is like 3mail* but includes information about the system version
and what machine you are on in the text of the message.  This information is
important to the maintainers of the faulty program; it aids them in reproducing
the bug and in determining whether it is one that is already being worked on
or has already been fixed.
.end_defun

.defun print-notifications &optional (from 30*) to
Reprints any notifications that have been received.  3from*
and 3to* are used to restrict which notifications are printed;
both count from the most recent notification as number 0.  Thus,
3(print-notifications 2 8)* prints six notifications after skipping
the two most recent.

The difference between notifications and sends is that sends come from
other users, while notifications are usually asynchronous messages from
the Lisp Machine system itself.  However, the default way for the system
to inform you about a send is to make a notification!  So
3print-notifications* 2normally* includes all sends as well.

Typing 3Terminal 1 N* pops up a window and calls 3print-notifications*
to print on it.
.end_defun

.defun si:print-disk-error-log
Prints information about the half dozen most recent disk errors (since the last cold boot).
.end_defun

.defun peek &optional character
Selects the PEEK utility, which displays various information about the
system, periodically updating it.  PEEK has several modes, which are
entered by typing a single key which is the name of the mode or by
clicking on the menu at the top.  The initial mode is selected by the
argument, 2character*.  If no argument is given, PEEK starts out
by explaining what its modes are.
.end_defun

.setq time-fun-2 page
.defun time form
Evaluates 2form* and prints the length of time that the evaluation
took.  The values of 2form* are returned.

Note that 3time* with no argument is a function to return
a time value counting in 60ths of a second; see (time-fun-1).  This unfortunate
collision is a consequence of Common Lisp.
.end_defun

.section The Lisp Listen Loop

	These functions constitute the Lisp top level read-eval-print
loop or 2listen loop* and its associated functions.

.cindex lisp top level
.cindex read-eval-print loop
.cindex listen loop

.defun si:lisp-top-level
This is the first function called in the initial Lisp environment.
It calls 3lisp-reinitialize*, clears the screen, and calls 3si:lisp-top-level1*.
.end_defun

.defun lisp-reinitialize
This function does a wide variety of things, such as resetting the values
of various global constants and initializing the error system.
.end_defun

.defun si:lisp-top-level1 *terminal-io*
This is the actual listen loop.  Within it, 3*terminal-io** is bound
to the argument supplied.  This is the stream used for reading and printing
if 3*standard-input** and 3*standard-output** are synonyms for 3*terminal-io**,
as they normally are.

The listen loop reads a form from 3*standard-input**, evaluates it,
prints the result (with escaping) to 3*standard-output**, and repeats
indefinitely.  If several values are returned by the form all of them
are printed.  Also the values of 3**, 3+*, 3-*, 3//*, 3++*,
3***, 3+++*, 3**** and 3*values** are maintained (see below).
.end_defun

.cindex break loop

.defun break format-string &rest format-args
Enters a breakpoint loop, which is similar
to a Lisp top level loop.    2format-string* and the 2format-args*
are passed to 3format* to print a message.
.lisp
;Breakpoint 2message*; Resume to continue, Abort to quit.
.end_lisp
and then enters a loop reading, evaluating, and printing forms.  A
difference between a break loop and the top level loop is that when
reading a form, 3break* checks for the following special cases: If the
3Abort* key is typed, control is returned to the previous break or
error-handler, or to top-level if there is none.  If the 3Resume* key is
typed, 3break* returns 3nil*.  If the list 3(return 2form*)* is typed,
3break* evaluates 2form* and returns the result, without ever
calling the function 3return*.

Inside the 3break* loop, the streams 3*standard-output**,
3*standard-input**, and 3query-io* are bound to be synonymous
to 3*terminal-io**; 3*terminal-io** itself is not rebound.  Several
other internal system variables are bound, and you can add your
own symbols to be bound by pushing elements onto the
value of the variable 3sys:*break-bindings**
(see (sys:*break-bindings*-var)).

3break* used to be a special form whose first argument was a string
or symbol which was simply printed 2without evaluating it*.
In order to facilitate conversion, 3break* really still is a special form.
If the call appears to use the old conventions, it behaves in the old way,
but the compiler issues a warning if it sees such code.
.end_defun

.defvar prin1
The value of this variable is normally 3nil*.  If it is non-3nil*,
then the read-eval-print loop uses its value instead of the
definition of 3prin1* to print the values returned by functions.
This hook lets you control how things are printed by all read-eval-print
loops--the Lisp top level, the 3break* function, and any utility
programs that include a read-eval-print loop.  It does not affect output
from programs that call the 3prin1* function or any of its relatives such
as 3print* and 3format*; if you want to do that, read about
customizing the printer, on (customizing-the-printer).  If you
set 3prin1* to a new function, remember that the read-eval-print loop
expects the function to print the value but not to output a 3return*
character or any other delimiters.
.end_defvar

.defvar -
While a form is being evaluated by a read-eval-print loop,
3-* is bound to the form itself.
.end_defvar

.defvar +
While a form is being evaluated by a read-eval-print loop,
3+* is bound to the previous form that was read by the loop.
.end_defvar

.defvar *
.defvar1 //
While a form is being evaluated by a read-eval-print loop,
3** is set to the result printed the last time through
the loop.  If there were several values printed (because
of a multiple-value return), 3** is bound to the first
value.  3//* is bound to a list of all the values of the
previous form.

If evaluation of a form is aborted, 3** and 3//* remain set to
the results of the last successfully completed form.  If evaluation
is successful but printing is aborted, 3** and 3//* are already
set for the following form.

Note that when using Common Lisp syntax you would type just 3/*.
.end_defvar

.defvar ++
3++* holds the previous value of 3+*, that is, the form evaluated
two interactions ago.
.end_defvar

.defvar +++
3+++* holds the previous value of 3++*.
.end_defvar

.defvar **
.defvar1 ////
Hold the previous values of 3** and 3//*, that is, the results of
the form evaluated two interactions ago.  Only forms whose evaluation
is successful cause the values of 3** and 3//* to move into
3*** and 3////*.

Note that when using Common Lisp syntax you would type just 3//*.
.end_defvar

.defvar ***
.defvar1 //////
Hold the previous values of 3*** and 3////*, that is, the results of
the form evaluated three interactions ago.
Note that when using Common Lisp syntax you would type just 3///*.
.end_defvar

.defvar *values*
3*values** holds a list of all lists of values produced by evaluation
in this Lisp listener.  3(car *values*)* is nearly equivalent to 3//*,
3(cadr *values*)* to 3////*, and so on.  The difference is that
an element is pushed on 3*values** for each form whose evaluation
is started.  If evaluation is aborted, the element of 3*values** is 3nil*.
.end_defvar

.defvar sys:*break-bindings*
When 3break* is called, it binds some special variables under control of
the list which is the value of 3sys:*break-bindings**.  Each element of the
list is a list of two elements: a variable and a form that is evaluated to
produce the value to bind it to.  The bindings happen sequentially.  Users may
3push* things on this list (adding to the front of it), but should not replace
the list wholesale since several of the variable bindings on this list are
essential to the operation of 3break*.
.end_defvar

.defvar lisp-crash-list
The value of 3lisp-crash-list* is a list of forms.
3lisp-reinitialize* sequentially evaluates these
forms, and then sets 3lisp-crash-list* to 3nil*.

In most cases, the 2initialization* facility should be used rather than
3lisp-crash-list*.  Refer to (initialization).
.end_defvar


.section The Garbage Collector
.cindex garbage collector
.setq garbage-collector page

.defun gc-on
Turns automatic garbage collection on.  Garbage collection will happen when
and as needed.  Automatic garbage collection is off by default.

Since garbage collection works by copying, you are asked for
confirmation if there may not be enough space to complete a garbage
collection even if it is started immediately.
.end_defun

.defun gc-off
Turns automatic garbage collection off.
.end_defun

.defvar gc-on
3t* when garbage collection is on, 3nil* when it is not.
You cannot control garbage collection by setting this variable;
it exists so you can examine it.  In particular, you can tell
if the system found it necessary to turn off garbage collection
because it was close to running out of virtual memory.
.end_defvar

Normally, automatic garbage collection happens in incremental mode; that
is, scavenging happens in parallel with computation.  Each consing
operation scavenges or copies four words per word consed.  In addition,
scavenging goes on whenever the machine appears idle.

.defvar si:inhibit-idle-scavenging-flag
If this is non-3nil*, scavenging is not done during idle time.
.end_defvar

If you are running a noninteractive crunching program, the incremental
nature of garbage collection may not be helpful.  Then you can make
garbage collection more efficient by making it a batch process.

.defvar si:gc-reclaim-immediately
If this variable is non-3nil*,
automatic garbage collection is done as a batch operation:
when the garbage collection process decides that the time has come,
it copies all the useful data and discards the old address space,
running full blast.  (It is still possible to use the machine while this is
going on, but it is slow.)  More specifically, the
garbage collection process scavenges and reclaims oldspace immediately
right after a flip happens, using all of the machine's
physical memory.  This variable is only relevant if you have turned on
automatic garbage collection with 3(gc-on)*.

A batch garbage collection requires less free space than an incremental
one.  If there is not enough space to complete an incremental garbage
collection, you may be able to win by selecting batch garbage collection
instead.
.end_defvar

.defvar si:gc-reclaim-immediately-if-necessary
If this variable is non-3nil*, then automatic garbage collection is
done in batch mode if, when the flip is done, there does not seem to
be enough space left to do it incrementally.  This variable's value is
relevant only if 3si:gc-reclaim-immediately* is 3nil*.
.end_defvar

.defvar si:gc-flip-ratio
This variable tells the garbage collector what fraction of the data it
should expect to have to copy, after each flip.  It should be a positive
number no larger than one.  By default, it is one.  But if your program
is consing considerable amounts of garbage, a value less than one may be
safe.  The garbage collector uses this variable to figure how much space
it will need to copy all the living data, and therefore indirectly how often
garbage collection must be done.
.end_defvar

.defvar si:gc-flip-minimum-ratio
This value is used, when non-3nil*, to control warnings about having
too little space to garbage collect.  Its value is a positive number
no greater than one, just like that of 3si:gc-flip-ratio*.  The
difference between the two is that 3si:gc-flip-ratio* controls when
garbage collection is 2recommended*, whereas
3si:gc-flip-minimum-ratio* controls when the system considers the
last possible time to do so.  If 3si:gc-flip-minimum-ratio* is
3nil*, 3si:gc-flip-ratio* serves both purposes.
.end_defvar

Garbage collection is turned off if it appears to be about to run out of
memory.  You get a notification if this happens.  You also get a
notification when you are nearly at the point of not having enough space
to guarantee garbage collecting successfully.

In addition to turning on automatic garbage collection, you can also
manually request one immediate complete collection with the function
3si:full-gc*.  The usual reason for doing this is to make a band smaller
before saving it.  3si:full-gc* also resets all temporary areas (see
3si:reset-temporary-area*, (si:reset-temporary-area-fun)).

.defun si:full-gc
Performs a complete garbage collection immediately.
This does not turn automatic garbage collection on or off;
it performs the garbage collection in the process you call it in.
A full gc of the standard system takes about 7 minutes, currently.
.end_defun

.defun si:clean-up-static-area area-number
This is a more selective way of causing static areas to be garbage
collected once.  The argument is the area number of a static area; that
particular area will be garbage collected the next time a garbage
collection is done (more precisely, it will be copied and discarded after the next
flip).  If you then call 3si:full-gc*, it will happen then.
.end_defun

.defun gc-status
The function 3gc-status* prints information related to garbage
collection.  When scavenging is in progress, it tells you how the task is
progressing.  While scavenging is not in progress and
oldspace does not exist, it prints information about how soon a new flip
will be required.
.end_defun

While a garbage collection is not in progress, the output from
3gc-status* looks like this:
.lisp
Dynamic (new+copy) space 557,417, Old space 0, Static 3,707,242,
Free space 10,453,032, with 10,055,355 needed for garbage collection
 assuming 100% live data (SI:GC-FLIP-RATIO = 1).
If GC is turned on, a flip will happen in 397,677 words.
Scavenging during cons Off, Idle scavenging On,
Automatic garbage collection Off.
GC Flip Ratio 1, GC Reclaim Immediately Off
.end_lisp
.lisp
.exdent 96 or
Dynamic (new+copy) space 561,395, Old space 0, Static 3,707,242,
Free space 10,453,032, with 10,058,670 needed for garbage collection
 assuming 100% live data (SI:GC-FLIP-RATIO = 1).
A flip will happen in 394,362 words.
Scavenging during cons On, Idle scavenging On,
Automatic garbage collection On.
GC Flip Ratio 1, GC Reclaim Immediately Off
.end_lisp

The ``dynamic space'' figure is the amount of garbage collectable space
and the ``static'' figure is the amount of static space used.
There is no old space since an old space only exists during garbage collection.

The amount of space needed for garbage collection represents an estimate
of how much space user programs will use up while scavenging is in
progress.  It includes a certain amount of padding.  The difference
between the free space and that amount is how much consing you can do
before a garbage collection will begin (if automatic garbage collection
is on).

The amount needed for a garbage collection depends on the value of
3si:*gc-reclaim-immediately**; more if it is 3nil*.

While a garbage collection is in progress, the output looks like this:
.lisp
Incremental garbage collection now in progress.
Dynamic (new+copy) space 45,137, Old space 972,514, Static 3,707,498,
Between 3,701,440 and 4,629,998 words of scavenging left to do.
Free space 9,289,795 (of which 928,558 might be needed for copying).
Ratio scavenging work/free space = 0.55.
Scavenging during cons On, Idle scavenging On,
Automatic garbage collection On.
GC Flip Ratio 1, GC Reclaim Immediately Off
.end_lisp

Notice that most of the dynamic space has become old space and new
space is small.  Not much has been copied since the flip took place.
The maximum and minimum estimates for the amount of scavenging are based
on different limits for how much of old space may need to be copied; as
scavenging progresses, the maximum decreases steadily, but the
minimum may increase.  The free space is smaller now, but it will get
larger when scavenging is finished and old space is freed up.  (The total
amounts are not the same now because unused parts of regions may not be
included in any of the figures.)

.defun si:set-scavenger-ws number-of-pages
Incremental scavenging is restricted to a fixed
amount of physical memory to reduce its interference with your other
activities.

This function specifies the number of pages of memory that incremental garbage
collection can use.  256 is a good value for a 256k machine.  If
the garbage collector gets very poor paging performance, use of this
function may fix it.
.end_defun

.section Logging In
.setq lispm-init-file section-page

	Logging in tells the Lisp Machine who you are, so that
other users can see who is logged in, you can receive messages,
and your INIT file can be run.  An INIT file is a Lisp program
which gets loaded when you log in; it can be used to set up
a personalized environment.

	When you log out, it should be possible to undo any
personalizations you have made so that they do not affect the next user
of the machine.  Therefore, anything done by an INIT file should be
undoable.  In order to do this, for every form in the INIT file, a Lisp
form to undo its effects should be added to the list that is the value
of 3logout-list*.  The 3login-forms* construct
helps make this easy; see below.

.defvar user-id
The value of 3user-id* is either the name of the logged in user, as a string,
or else an empty string if there is no user logged in.
It appears in the who-line.
.end_defvar

.defvar logout-list
The value of 3logout-list* is a list of forms to be evaluated
when the user logs out.
.end_defvar

.defun login name &optional host inhibit-init-file
Sets your name (the variable 3user-id*) to 2name* and logs in a file
server on 2host*.  2host* also becomes your default file host.  The default
value of 2host* depends on which Lisp Machine you use using; it is
called the associated machine (see (si:associated-machine-var)).
3login* also runs the 3:login* initialization list (see
(login-init-list)).

If 2host* requires passwords for logging in you are asked for a
password.  Adding an asterisk at the front of your password enables any
special capabilities you may be authorized to use, by calling
3fs:enable-capabilities* ((fs:enable-capabilities-fun)).

Unless 2inhibit-init-file* is specified as non-3nil*, 3login* loads
your init file if it exists.  On ITS, your init file is 2name* 3LISPM*
on your home directory.  On TOPS-20 your init file is 3LISPM.INIT* on your
directory.  On VMS, it is 3LISPM.INI*.  On Unix, it is 3lispm.init*.

If anyone is logged into the machine already, 3login* logs him out
before logging in 2name*.  (See 3logout*.)  Init files should be
written using the 3login-forms* construct so that 3logout* can undo
them.  Usually, however, you cold-boot the machine before logging in, to
remove any traces of the previous user.  3login* returns 3t*.
.end_defun

.defun log1 &rest options
Like 3login* but the arguments are specified differently.
2options* is a list of keywords and values; the keywords
3:host* and 3:init* specify the host to log in on and whether
to load the init file if any.  Any other keywords are also allowed.
3log1* itself ignores them, but the init file can act on them.
The purpose of 3log1*, as opposed to 3login*, is to enable you
to specify other keywords for your init file's sake.
.end_defun

.defvar si:user-init-options
During the execution of the user's init file, inside 3log1*,
this variable contains the arguments given to 3log1*.
Options not meaningful to 3log1* itself can be specified, so that
the init file can find them here and act on them.
.end_defvar

.defun logout
First, 3logout* evaluates the forms on 3logout-list*.
Then it sets 3user-id* to an empty string and 3logout-list*
to 3nil*.  Then it runs the 3:logout* initialization list
(see (login-init-list)), and returns 3t*.
.end_defun

.defmac login-forms undoable-forms...
The body of a 3login-forms* is composed of forms to be evaluated,
whose effects are to be undone if you log out.  For example,
.lisp
(login-forms
  (setq fs:*defaults-are-per-host* t))
.end_lisp
would set the variable immediately but arrange for its previous value
to be restored if you log out.

3login-forms* is not an AI program; it must be told how to undo each
function that will be used immediately inside it.  This is done by
giving the function name (such as 3setq*) a 3:undo-function*
property which is a function that takes a form as an argument and
returns a form to undo the original form.  For 3setq*, this is done as
follows:
.lisp
(defun (setq :undo-function) (form &aux results)
  (do ((l (cdr form) (cddr l)))
      ((null l))
    (cond ((boundp (car l))
	   (push `(setq ,(car l) ',(symeval (car l))) results))
	  (t (push `(makunbound ',(car l)) results))))
  `(progn . ,results))
.end_lisp

Undo functions are standardly provided for the functions 3setq*,
3pkg-goto-globally*, 3setq-globally*, 3add-initialization*,
3deff*, 3defun*, 3defsubst*, 3macro*, 3advise* and
3zwei:set-comtab*.  Constructs which macroexpand into uses of those
functions are also supported.

Note that setting 3*read-base** and 3*print-base** should be done with 3setq-globally*
rather than 3setq*, since those variables are likely to be bound by the
3load* function while the init file is executed.
.end_defmac

.defmac login-setq {variable value}...
3login-setq* is like 3setq* except that it puts
a 3setq* form on 3logout-list* to set the variables
to their previous values.  3login-setq* is obsolete; use 3login-forms*
around a 3setq* instead.
.end_defmac

.defun login-eval x
3login-eval* is used for functions that are ``meant to be called''
from INIT files, such as 3zwei:set-comtab-return-undo*, which conveniently
return a form to undo what they did.  3login-eval* pushes
the result of the form 2x* onto 3logout-list*.  It is obsolete now
because 3login-forms* is a cleaner interface.
.end_defun

.defun si:undoable-forms-1 undo-list-name forms &optional complaint-string
This is what 3login-forms* uses.
2forms* is a list of forms; they are evaluated and forms for
undoing their effects are pushed onto the value of the symbol
2undo-list-name*.  If an element of 2forms* has no known
way to be undone, a message is printed using the string 2complaint-string*.
For 3login-forms*, the string supplied is 3"at logout"*.
.end_defun

.section Dribble Files
.cindex dribble file

.defun dribble &optional filename
With an argument, 3dribble* opens 2filename* as a `dribble file' (also
known as a `wallpaper file') and then enters a Lisp listen loop
in which 3*standard-input**
and 3*standard-output** are rebound to direct all the output and
echoing they do to the file as well as to the terminal.

Dribble output can be sent to an editor buffer by using a suitable
pathname; see (editor-hosts).

Calling 3dribble* with no arguments terminates dribbling; it throws to
the original call to 3dribble*, which closes the file and returns.
.end_defun

.defun dribble-all &optional filename
Like 3dribble* except that all input and
output goes to the dribble file, including break loops, queries,
warnings and sessions in the debugger.  This works by binding
3*terminal-io** instead of 3*standard-output** and 3*standard-input**.
.end_defun

.section Version Information

Common Lisp defines several standard ways of inquiring about
the identity and capabilities of the Lisp system you are using.

.defvar *features*
A list of atoms which describe the software and hardware features
of the Lisp implementation.  By default, this is
.lisp
(:loop :defstruct :lispm :cadr :mit :chaos :sort :fasload :string
 :newio :roman :trace :grindef :grind :common)
.end_lisp
Most important is the symbol 3:lispm*; this indicates that the program
is executing on the Lisp Machine.  3:cadr* indicates the type of
hardware, 3:mit* which version of the Lisp Machine operating system,
and 3:chaos* that the Chaosnet protocol is available.  3:common*
indicates that Common Lisp is supported.

Most of the other elements are for Maclisp compatibility.  Common Lisp
defines the variable 3*features** but does not define what should
appear in the list.  The order of elements in the list has no
significance.  Membership checks should use 3string-equal* so that
packages are not significant

The 7#+* and 7#-* read constructs ((sharp-plus)) check for the
presence of an element in this list.  Thus, 7#+*3lispm* when read by
a Lisp Machine causes the following expression to be significant,
because 3:lispm* is present in the features list.
.end_defvar

The remaining standard means of inquiry are specified by Common Lisp to
be functions rather than variables, for reasons that seem poorly thought
out.

.defun lisp-implementation-type
Returns a string saying what kind of Lisp implementation you are using.
On the Lisp Machine it is always 3"Zetalisp"*.
.end_defun

.defun lisp-implementation-version
Returns a string saying the version numbers of the Lisp implementation.
On the Lisp Machine it looks something like
.lisp
3"System 98.3, CADR 3.0, ZMAIL 52.2"*.
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun machine-type
Returns a string describing the kind of hardware in use.
It is 3"CADR"* or 3"LAMBDA"*.
.end_defun

.defun machine-version
Returns a string describing the kind of hardware and microcode version.
It starts with the value of 3machine-type*.
It might be 3"CADR Microcode 309"*.
.end_defun

.defun machine-instance
Returns a string giving the name of this machine.  Do not be confused;
the value is a string, not an instance.  Example:  3"CADR-18"*.
.end_defun

.defun software-type
Returns a string describing the type of operating system software that Lisp
is working with.  On the Lisp Machine, it is always 3"Zetalisp"*, since the
Lisp Machine Lisp software is the operating system.
.end_defun

.defun software-version
Returns a string describing the version numbers of the operating system software
in use.  This is the same as 3lisp-implementation-version* on the Lisp Machine
since the same software is being described.
.end_defun

.defun short-site-name
Returns a string giving briefly the name of the site you are at.
A site is an institution which has a group of Lisp Machines.
The string you get is the value of the 3:short-site-name* site option
as given in 3SYS: SITE; SITE LISP*.  See (site-files) for more
information.  Example: 3"MIT AI Lab"*.
.end_defun

.defun long-site-name
Returns a string giving a verbose name for the site you are at.  This
string is specified by the site option 3:long-site-name*.  Example:
3"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory"*.
.end_defun

.section Booting and Disk Partitions
.setq disk-partition section-page
.cindex band
.cindex partition
.cindex booting

A Lisp Machine disk is divided into several named 2partitions* (also
called 2bands* sometimes).  Partitions can be used for many things.
Every disk has a partition named 3PAGE*, which is used to implement
the virtual memory of the Lisp Machine.  When you run Lisp, this is
where the Lisp world actually resides.  There are also partitions that
hold saved images of the Lisp Machine microcode, conventionally named
3MCR2n** (where 2n* is a digit), and partitions that hold saved
images of Lisp worlds, conventionally named 3LOD2n**.  A saved image
of a Lisp world is also called a 2virtual memory load* or 2system load*.
The microcode and system load are stored separately so that the
microcode can be changed without going through the time-consuming
process of generating a new system load.

The directory of partitions is in a special block on the disk called the
label.  The label names one of the partitions as the current microcode
and one as the current system load.  When you cold-boot, the contents
of the current microcode band are loaded into the microcode memory, and
then the contents of the current saved image of the Lisp world is copied
into the 3PAGE* partition.  Then Lisp starts running.  When you
warm-boot, the contents of the current microcode band are loaded, but
Lisp starts running using the data already in the 3PAGE* partition.

For each partition, the directory of partitions contains a brief textual
description of the contents of the partition.  For microcode partitions,
a typical description might be 3"UCADR 310"*; this means that version
3310* of the microcode is in the partition.  For saved Lisp images, it
is a little more complicated.  Ideally, the description would say which
versions of which systems are loaded into the band.  Unfortunately,
there isn't enough room for that in most cases.  A typical description
is 3"99.4 Daed 5.1"*, meaning that this band contains version
399.4* of 3System* and version 35.1* of 3Daedalus*.  The description
is created when a Lisp world is saved away by 3disk-save* (see below).

.subsection Manipulating the Label

.defun print-disk-label &optional (unit 30*) (stream 3*standard-output**)
Prints a description of the label of the disk specified by 2unit* onto
2stream*.  The description starts with the name of the disk pack,
various information about the disk that is generally uninteresting, and
the names of the two current load partitions (microcode and saved Lisp
image).  This is followed by one line of description for each
partition.  Each one has a name, disk address, size, and textual
comment.  The current microcode partition and the current system
load partition are marked with asterisks, each at the beginning of the line.

2unit* may be the unit number of the disk (most Lisp machines just
have one unit, number 0), or the host name of another Lisp Machine on
the Chaosnet, as a string (in which case the label of unit 30* on that
machine is printed, and the user of that machine is notified that you
are looking at his label), or, for CADRs only, the string 3"CC"*
(which prints the label of unit 0 of the machine connected to this
machine's debugging hardware).

Use of 3"CC"* as the 2unit* is the way to examine or fix up
the label of a machine which cannot work because of problems with the
label.  On a Lambda, this must be done through the SDU.
.end_defun

.defun set-current-band partition-name &optional (unit 30*)
Sets the current saved Lisp image partition to be 2partition-name*.
If 2partition-name* is a number, the name 3LOD2n** is used.

2unit* can be a disk drive number, the host name of another Lisp
Machine, or the string 3"CC"*.  See the comments under
3print-disk-label*, above.

If the partition you specify goes with a version of microcode different
from the one that is current, this function offers to select the
an appropriate microcode partition as well.  Normally you should
answer 3Y*.
.end_defun

.defun set-current-microload partition-name &optional (unit 30*)
Sets the current microcode partition to be 2partition-name*.
If 2partition-name* is a number, the name 3MCR2n** is used.

2unit* can be a disk drive number, the host name of another Lisp
Machine, or the string 3"CC"*.  See the comments under
3print-disk-label*, above.
.end_defun

.defun si:current-band &optional (unit 30*)
.defun1 si:current-microload &optional (unit 30*)
Return, respectively, the name of the current band and the current microload on the
specified unit.
.end_defun

When using the functions to set the current load partitions, be extra
sure that you are specifying the correct partition.  Having done it,
cold-booting the machine will reload from those partitions.  Some
versions of the microcode will not work with some versions of the Lisp
system, and if you set the two current partitions incompatibly,
cold-booting the machine will fail.  To fix this, on a CADR, use
another CADR's debugging hardware, running
3print-disk-label* and 3set-current-band* on the other CADR and
giving 3"CC"* as the 2unit* argument.  On a Lambda, this is done
via the SDU.

.defun si:edit-disk-label unit &optional init-p
Runs an interactive label editor on the specified unit.
This editor allows you to change any field in the label.  The
3Help* key documents the commands.  You have to be an expert
to need this and to understand what it does, so the commands
are not documented here.  Ask someone if you need help.
You can screw yourself very badly with this function.
.end_defun

.defun disk-restore &optional partition
Allows booting from a band other than the current one.  2partition*
may be the name or the number of a disk partition containing a
virtual-memory load, or 3nil* or omitted, meaning to use the current
partition.  The specified partition is copied into the paging area of
the disk and then started.

Although you can use this to boot a different Lisp image than the installed
one, this does not provide a way to boot a different microcode image.
3disk-restore* brings up the new band with the currently running microcode.

3disk-restore* asks the user for confirmation before doing it.
.end_defun

.defun describe-partition partition &optional unit
Tells you various useful things about a partition; including where on
disk the partition begins, and how long it is.

If you specify a saved Lisp system partition, such as 3LOD3*, it also
tells you important information about the contents of the partition: the
microcode version which the partition goes with, the size of the data in
the partition and the highest virtual address used.  The size of the partition
tells how large a partition you need to make a copy of this one, and the
highest virtual address used (which is measured in units of disk
blocks) tells you how large a 3PAGE* partition you need in order to run
this partition.
.end_defun

.subsection Updating Software

Of all the procedures described in this section, the most common one is
to take a partition containing a Lisp image, update it to have all the
latest patches (see (patch-facility)), and save it away in a disk
partition.  The function 3load-and-save-patches* does it all
conveniently for you.

.defun load-and-save-patches
Loads patches and saves a band, with a simple user interface.  Run this
function immediately after cold booting, without logging in first; it
logs in automatically as 3LISPM* (or whatever is specified in the site files).
The first thing it does is print the list of disk partitions and ask you
which one to save in.  Answer 3LOD2n**, using the name of a partition
from the printed list.  You must then confirm.  Then the patches are loaded
and the resulting world is saved with no further user interaction, as long
as no problem arises.

It is convenient to use this function just before you depart, allowing
it to finish unattended.
.end_defun

If you wish to do something other than loading all and only the latest
patches, you must perform the steps by hand.  Start by cold-booting the
machine, to get a fresh, empty system.  Next, you must log in as
something whose INIT file does not affect the Lisp world noticably (so
that when you save away the Lisp image, the side-effects of the INIT
file won't get saved too); on MIT-OZ, for example, you can log in as
3LISPM* with password 3LISPM*.  Now you can load in any new software
you want; usually you should also do 3(load-patches)* for good
measure.  You may also want to call 3si:set-system-status* to change
the release status of the system.

When you're done loading everything, do 3(print-disk-label)* to find
a band in which to save your new Lisp world.  It is best not to reuse
the current band, since if something goes wrong during the saving of
the partition, while you have written, say, half of the band that is
current, it may be impossible to cold-boot the machine.  Once you have
found the partition, you use the 3disk-save* function to save
everything into that partition.

.defun disk-save partition-name &optional no-query incremental
Saves the current Lisp world in the designated partition.
2partition-name* may be a partition name (a string), or it may be a
number in which case the name 3LOD2n** is used.

The user is first asked for yes-or-no confirmation that he really wants to
reuse the named partition.  A non-3nil* value for 2no-query* prevents
this question.  This is only for callers that have already asked.

Next it is necessary to figure out what to put into the textual
description of the band, for the disk label.  This starts with the brief
version of 3si:system-version-info* (see
(si:system-version-info-fun)).  Then comes a string of additional
information; if 2no-query* is 3nil*, the user is offered the chance
to provide a new string.  The current value of this string is returned
by 3si:system-version-info* and printed by booting.  The version info
and the string both go in the comment field of the disk label for this
band.  If they don't together fit into the fixed size available, the
user is asked to retype the whole thing (the version info as well as
your comment) in a compressed form that does fit.

The Lisp environment is then saved away into the designated partition,
and then the equivalent of a cold-boot from that partition is done.
.end_defun

Once the patched system has been successfully saved and the system
comes back up, you can make it current with 3set-current-band*.

When you do a 3disk-save*, it may tell you that the band you wish to save
in is not big enough to hold all the data in your current world.  It may be
possible for you to reduce the size of the data so that it will fit in that
band, by garbage collecting.  Simply do 3(si:full-gc)*.

Try to avoid saving patched systems after running the editor or the
compiler.  This works, but it makes the saved system a lot bigger.  In
order to produce a clean saved environment, you should try to do as
little as possible between the time you cold-boot and the time you save
the partition.

.defvar si:login-history
The value of 3si:login-history* is a list of entries, one for each person who
has logged into this world since it was created.  This makes it possible to
tell who 3disk-saved* a band with something broken in it.  Each entry is
a list of the user ID, the host logged into, the Lisp Machine on which the
world was being executed, and the date and time.
.end_defvar

.subsection Saving Personal Software

If you have a large application system which takes a while to load,
you may wish to save a band containing it.

To do this, boot a fresh band, log in without running your init file,
do 3make-system* to load the application system, and then invoke
3disk-save*.  When 3disk-save* asks for an additional comment,
give your name or the name of the application system you loaded,
and a date.  This will tell other people who to ask whether the
band is still in use if they would like to save other things.

You can greatly reduce the amount of disk space needed for the saved
band by making it an 2incremental* band; that is, a band which
contains the differences between the Lisp world you want to save and the
system band you originally loaded.  Since all the pages of the system
which your application program did not change do not have to be saved,
an incremental band is generally much smaller--perhaps by a factor of ten.

To make an incremental band, give a non-3nil* third argument to
3disk-save*, as in
.lisp
(disk-save "lod4" nil t)
.end_lisp
Figuring out which pages need to be saved in the incremental band
takes a couple of extra minutes.

You can restore the incremental band with 3disk-restore* or boot it like
any other band.  This works by first booting the original band and then
copying in the differences that the incremental band records.  It takes
only a little longer than booting the original system band.

The original band to which an incremental band refers must be a complete load.
When you update a standard system band (loading patches, for instance) you
should always make a complete load, so that the previous system band is not
needed for the new one to function.

The incremental band records the partition name of the original system
band.  That original band must still exist, with the same contents, in
order for the incremental band to work properly.  The incremental band
contains some error check data which is used to verify this.  The error checking is
done by the microcode when the incremental band is booted, but it is
also done by 3set-current-band*, so that you are not permitted to select
an incremental band if it is not going to work.

When using incremental bands, it is important to preserve the system bands
that they depend on.  Therefore, system bands should not be updated too
frequently.  3describe-partition* on an incremental band says which
full band it depends on; you can use this to determine which bands should
be kept for the sake of incremental bands that depend on them.

In order to realize the maximum savings in disk space possible because
of incremental bands, you must make the partition you saved in smaller
once the save is finished and you know how much space was actually used.
This is done with 3si:edit-disk-label*.
The excess space at the end of the partition can be used to make another
partition which is used for the next incremental band saved.  Eventually
when some of the incremental bands are no longer needed the rest must
be shuffled so that the free space can be put together into larger partitions.
This can be done with 3si:copy-disk-partition*.

An easier technique is to divide a couple of the initial partitions into
several equal-sized partitions of about 4000 pages, and use these for
all incremental saving.  You can easily provide room for 12 incremental
bands this way in addition to a few system bands and file system.

You must not do a garbage collection to reduce the size of the world
before you make an an incremental band.  This is because garbage
collection alters so many pages that an incremental band would be as big
as a complete band.

.subsection Copying Bands

The normal way to install new software on a machine is
to copy the microcode and world load bands from another machine.

The first step is to find a machine that is not in use and has the
desired system.  Let us call this the source machine.  The machine
where the new system is to be installed is the target machine.  You
can use 3finger* to see which machines are free, and use
3print-disk-label* with an argument to examine the label of that
machine's disk and see if it has the system you want.

Then you should do a 3(print-disk-label)* to find suitable
partitions to copy them into.  It is advisable not to copy them
into the selected partitions; if you did that, and the machine
crashed in the middle, you would be unable to boot it.

Before copying a band from another machine, double-check the partition
names by printing the labels of both machines, and make sure no one is
using the other machine.  Also double-check with
3describe-partition* that the world load and microcode go together.
Then use this function:

.defun si:receive-band source-host source-band target-band &optional subset-start subset-size
Copies the partition on 2source-host*'s partition named
2source-band* onto the local machine's partition named
2target-band*.  This takes about ten minutes.  It types out the size
of the partition in pages, and types a number every 100 pages telling
how far it has gotten.  It displays an entry in the who line on the
remote machine saying what's going on.

The 2subset-start* and 2subset-size* arguments can be used to
transfer only part of a partition.  They are measured in blocks.
The default for the first is zero, and the default for the second is
to continue to the end of the data in the band.  These arguments are useful for
restarting a transfer that was aborted due to network problems or a crash,
based on the count of hundreds of blocks that was printed out before
the crash.
.end_defun

To go the other direction, use 3si:transmit-band*.

.defun si:transmit-band source-band target-host target-band &optional subset-start subset-size
This is just like 3si:receive-band*, except you use it on
the source machine instead of the target machine.  It copies
the local machine's partition named 2source-band* onto
2target-machine*'s partition named 2target-band*.

It is preferable to use 3si:receive-band* so that you are present
at the machine being written on. 
.end_defun

After transferring the band, it is good practice to make sure that it really
was copied successfully by comparing the original and the copy.  All of the
known reasons for errors during band transfer have (of course) been corrected,
but peace of mind is valuable.  If the copy was not perfectly faithful, you
might not find out about it until a long time later, when you use whatever part
of the system that had not been copied properly.

.defun si:compare-band source-host source-band target-band &optional subset-start subset-size
This is like 3si:receive-band*, except that it does not change anything.
It compares the two bands and complains about any differences.
.end_defun

Having gotten the current microcode load and system load copied into
partitions on your machine, you can make them current for booting using
3set-current-band*.

.section Site Options and Host Table
.setq site-files section-page
.cindex site options

The Lisp Machine system has options that are set at each site.  These
include the network addresses of other hosts, which hosts have file
servers, which host to find the system source files and patch files on,
where to send bug reports, what timezone the site is located in, and many
other things.

The per-site information is defined by three files: 3SYS: SITE; SITE LISP*,
3SYS: SITE; LMLOCS LISP*, and 3SYS: CHAOS; HOSTS TXT*.
.setq host-table page
.cindex host table

3SYS: CHAOS; HOSTS TXT* is the network host table.  It gives the names
and addresses of all hosts that are to be known to the Lisp Machine for any
purposes.  It also says what type of machine the host is, and what operating
system runs on it.

3SYS: SITE; LMLOCS LISP* specifies various information about the Lisp
Machines at your site, including its name, where it is physically located,
and what the default machine for logging in should be.

3SYS: SITE; SITE LISP* specifies all other site-specific information.
Primarily, this is contained in a call to the special form 3defsite*.

.defmac defsite site-name (site-option value)...
This special form defines the values of site-specific options, and also
gives the name of the site.  Each 2site-option* is a symbol, normally in
the keyword package, which is the name of some site option.  2value* is
the value for that option; it is evaluated.  Here is a list of
standardly defined site options:

.table 3
.kitem :sys-host
The value is a string, the name of the host on which the system source
files are stored.  This host becomes the translation of logical host 3SYS*.

.kitem :sys-host-translation-alist
The value is an alist mapping host names into translation-list variables.
Each translation list variable's value should be an alist suitable for being
the third argument to 3fs:add-logical-pathname-host* (see
(fs:add-logical-pathname-host-fun)).  The car of an element may be 3nil*
instead of a host name; then this element applies to all hosts not
mentioned.

The normal place to find the system sources is on the host specified by the
3:sys-host* keyword, in the directories specified by the translation list
variable found by looking that host up in the value of the
3:sys-host-translation-alist* keyword.  If you specify a different host
as the system host with 3si:set-sys-host*, that host is also looked
up in this alist to find out what directories to use there.

.lisp
.exdent 96 Here is what is used at MIT:

(defsite :mit
  ...
  (:sys-host-translation-alist
    '(("AI" . its-sys-pathname-translations)
      ("OZ" . oz-sys-pathname-translations)
      ("FS" . its-sys-pathname-translations)
      ("LM" . its-sys-pathname-translations)
      (nil . its-sys-pathname-translations)))
  ...)
.end_lisp
.lisp
(defconst oz-sys-pathname-translations
  '(("CC;" "<L.CC>")
    ("CHAOS;" "<L.CHAOS>")
    ("DEMO;" "<L.DEMO>")
    ...
    ("SITE;" "<L.SITE>")
    ("SYS;" "<L.SYS>")
    ("SYS2;" "<L.SYS2>")
    ...
    ("ZMAIL;" "<L.ZMAIL>")
    ("ZWEI;" "<L.ZWEI>")
    ))
.end_lisp

.kitem :sys-login-name
.xitem1 :sys-login-password defsite
These specify the username and password to use to log in automatically to read system
patch files, microcode symbol tables and error tables.
The values should be strings.

.kitem :chaos
3nil* if the site has no Chaosnet; otherwise, a string,
the name of the Chaosnet that the site is on.  Names for Chaosnets
will eventually be used to permit communication between Chaosnets,
probably through special gateway servers.  Except when multiple
sites are on a single Chaosnet, normally the Chaosnet name
should be the same as the site name (but as a string, not a symbol).

.kitem :standalone
The value should be 3t* for a Lisp Machine that is operated without
a network connection.  This causes the Lisp Machine to not to try to
use the Chaosnet for getting the time.  On the Lambda, the time will
obtained from the SDU's clock.  On the CADR, the time will be obtained
from the user.

.kitem :default-associated-machine
This should be a string which is the name of a host to use as the
associated host for any Lisp Machine not mentioned in the LMLOCS file.

.kitem :usual-lm-name-prefix
This should be a string which is the typical beginning of host names of
Lisp Machines at your site.  At MIT, it is 3"CADR-"*.

.kitem :chaos-file-server-hosts
This should be a list of names of hosts that have file servers, including
Lisp Machines which other Lisp Machines should know about.

.kitem :lmfile-server-hosts
This should be a list of names of Lisp Machines that provide servers for
the LMFILE file system.  The entry for such a machine should be one of
the nicknames of that machine.  By virtue of its presence in this list,
it becomes the name by which the LMFILE file system there can be
accessed remotely.

.kitem :chaos-time-server-hosts
This should be a list of names of hosts that support TIME servers.
These are hosts that the Lisp Machine can ask the time of day from
when you boot.

.kitem :chaos-host-table-server-hosts
This should be a list of names of hosts that support host-table servers,
which can be used to inquire about hosts on networks that the Lisp Machine
does not know about in its own host table.

.kitem :chaos-mail-server-hosts
This should be a list of names of hosts that support mail servers which are
capable of forwarding mail to any known host.

.kitem :timezone
This should be a number, the number of hours earlier than GMT of standard
time in the timezone where this site is located.

.kitem :host-for-bug-reports
This should be a string, the name of the host at which bug-report mailboxes
are located.

.kitem :local-mail-hosts
This should be a list of names of hosts that ZMail should consider ``local''
and omit from its summary display.

.kitem :spell-server-hosts
This should be a list of hosts that have spelling corrector servers.

.kitem :comsat
This should be 3t* if mail can be sent through the COMSAT mail demon.
This is true only at MIT.

.kitem :default-mail-mode
This should be the default mode for use in sending mail.
The options are 3:file* (use COMSAT), 3:chaos* (use one of the
3:chaos-mail-server-hosts*), or 3:chaos-direct* (like 3:chaos*, but
go direct to the host that the mail is addressed to whenever possible).

.kitem :gmsgs
This should be 3t* if GMSGS servers are available.

.kitem :arpa-gateways
This should be a list of names of hosts that can be used as gateways to the
Arpanet.  These hosts must provide a suitable Chaosnet server which will
make Arpanet connections.  It should be 3nil* if your site does not have
an Arpanet connection.

.kitem :arpa-contact-name
If you have Arpanet gateways, this is the Chaosnet contact name to use.
Nowadays, it should be 3"TCP"*.

.kitem :dover
This should be 3t* if your site has a Dover printer.

.kitem :default-printer
This should be a keyword which describes
the default printer for hardcopy
commands and functions to use.  Possible values include 3:dover*,
3nil*, or any other printer type that you define (see (hardcopy)).

.kitem :default-bit-array-printer
Like 3:default-printer*, but this is the default for only 3hardcopy-bit-array* to use.

.kitem :esc-f-arg-alist
This says what various numeric arguments to the 3Terminal F* command
mean.  It is a list of elements, one for each possible argument.
The car of an element is either a number or 3nil* (which applies to
3Terminal F* with no argument).  The cdr is either 3:login*
(finger the login host), 3:lisp-machines* (finger all Lisp Machines at
this site), 3:read* (read some hosts from the keyboard), or a list of
host names.

.kitem :verify-lm-dumps
If the value is 3t*, Lisp Machine file system dump tapes are
verified.
.end_table

Other site options are allowed, and your own software can look for them.
.end_defmac

.subsection Updating Site Information

To update the site files, you must first recompile the sources.
Do this by
.lisp
(make-system 'site 'compile)
.end_lisp
This also loads the site files.

To just load the site files, assuming they are compiled, do
.lisp
(make-system 'site)
.end_lisp

3load-patches* does that automatically.

You should never load any site file directly.  All the files must be loaded
in the proper fashion and sequence, or the machine may stop working.

.subsection Accessing Site Options

Programs examine the site options using these variables and functions:

.defvar site-name
The value of this variable is the name of the site you are running at, as
defined in the 3defsite* in the 3SITE* file.  You can use this in run-time
conditionals for various sites.
.end_defvar

.defun get-site-option keyword
Returns the value of the site option 2keyword*.
The value is 3nil* if 2keyword* is not mentioned in the 3SITE* file.
.end_defun

.defmac define-site-variable variable keyword [documentation]
Defines a variable named 2variable* whose value is always the same as
that of the site option 2keyword*.  When new site files are loaded,
the variable's value is updated.  2documentation* is the variable's
documentation string, as in 3defvar*.
.end_defmac

.defmac define-site-host-list variable keyword [documentation]
Defines a variable named 2variable* whose value is a list of host objects
specified by the site option 2keyword*.  The value actually specified in
the 3SITE* file should be a list of host names.  When new site files are
loaded, the variable's value is updated.  2documentation* is the
variable's documentation string, as in 3defvar*.
.end_defmac

.subsection The LMLOCS File

The 3LMLOCS* file contains an entry for each Lisp Machine at your
site, and tells the system whatever it needs to know about the
particular machine it is running on.  It contains one form, a
3defconst* for the variable 3machine-location-alist*.  The value
should have an element for each Lisp Machine, of this form:

.lisp
("MIT-LISPM-1"  "Lisp Machine One"
 "907 [Son of CONS] CADR1's Room x6765"
 (MIT-NE43 9) "OZ" ((:default-printer :dover)))

.exdent 96 The general pattern is

(2host-full-name* 2pretty-name*
 2location-string*
 (2building* 2floor*) 2associated-machine* 2site-options*) 
.end_lisp

The 2host-full-name* is the same as in the host table.

The 2pretty-name* is simply for printing out for users on certain occasions.

The 2location-string* should say where to find the machine's console,
preferably with a telephone number.  This is for the 3FINGER* server
to provide to other hosts.

The 2building* and 2floor* are a somewhat machine-understandable
version of the location.

The 2associated-machine* is the default file server host name for
login on this Lisp Machine.

2site-options* is a list of site options, just like what goes in the
3defsite*.  These site options apply only to the particular machine,
overriding what is present in the 3SITE* file.  In our example, the
site option 3:default-printer* is specified as being 3:dover*, on
this machine only.

.defvar si:associated-machine
The host object for the associated machine of this Lisp Machine.
.end_defvar
