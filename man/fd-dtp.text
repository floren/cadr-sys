.section Data Types

This section enumerates some of the various different primitive types of
objects in Zetalisp.  The types explained below include
symbols, conses, various types of numbers, two kinds of compiled code
objects, locatives, arrays, stack groups, and closures.
.cindex symbol
.cindex print name
.cindex definition
.cindex property list

	A 2symbol* (these are sometimes called ``atoms'' or ``atomic
symbols'' by other texts) has a 2print name*, a 2value*, a
2definition*, a 2property list*, and a 2package*.

	The print name is a string, which may be obtained by the
function 3symbol-name* ((symbol-name-fun)).  This string serves as the
2printed representation* (see (printer)) of the symbol.

Each symbol
has a 2value*, which may be any
Lisp object.  This is the value of the symbol when regarded as a dynamic variable.
It is also referred to sometimes as the ``contents of the
value cell'', since internally every symbol has a cell called the 2value
cell*, which holds the value.  It is accessed by the 3symeval*
function ((symeval-fun)), and updated by the 3set* function
((set-fun)).  (That is, given a symbol, you use 3symeval* to find out
what its value is, and use 3set* to change its value.)

Each
symbol has a 2definition*, which may also be any Lisp object.  It is
also referred to as the ``contents of the function cell'', since
internally every symbol has a cell called the 2function cell*, which
holds the definition.  The definition can be accessed by the
3fsymeval* function ((fsymeval-fun)), and updated with 3fset*
((fset-fun)), although usually the functions 3fdefinition* and
3fdefine* are employed ((fdefine-fun)).

The property list is a list of an even number of
elements; it can be accessed directly by 3plist* ((plist-fun)), and
updated directly by 3setplist* ((setplist-fun)), although usually the
functions 3get*, 3putprop*, and 3remprop* ((get-fun)) are used.
The property list is used to associate any number of additional
attributes with a symbol--attributes not used frequently enough to
deserve their own cells as the value and definition do.

  Symbols also have a
package cell, which indicates which package of names the symbol
belongs to.  This is explained further in the section on packages
(chapter (package-chapter)) and can be disregarded by the casual user.

	The primitive function for creating symbols is
3make-symbol* ((make-symbol-fun)), although most symbols
are created by 3read*, 3intern*, or
3fasload* (which call 3make-symbol* themselves.)

	A 2cons* is an object that cares about two
other objects, arbitrarily named the 2car* and the 2cdr*.
These objects can be accessed with 3car* and 3cdr* ((car-fun)), and updated
with 3rplaca* and 3rplacd* ((rplaca-fun)).  The primitive function for creating
conses is 3cons* ((cons-fun)).

	There are several kinds of numbers in Zetalisp.  2Fixnums*
represent integers in the range of -2^24 to 2^24-1.  2Bignums*
represent integers of arbitrary size, but they are more expensive to use
than fixnums because they occupy storage and are slower.  The system
automatically converts between fixnums and bignums as required.
2Floats* are floating-point numbers.  2Short floats* are another
kind of floating-point numbers, with less range and precision, but less
computational overhead.  2Ratios* are exact rational numbers that are
represented with a numerator and a denominator, which are integers.
2Complexnums* are numbers that have explicitly represented real and
imaginary parts, which can be any real numbers of the same type.  See
(number) for full details of these types and the conversions between
them.

.cindex character object
A 2character object* is much like a fixnum except that its type
is distinguishable.  Common Lisp programs use character objects to
represent characters.  Traditional programs usually use fixnums to
represent characters, although they can create an manipulate character
objects when they desire.  Character objects behave like fixnums
when used in arithmetic; only a few operations make any distinction.
They do, however, print distinctively.  See (characters) for more information.

.cindex FEF
	The usual form of compiled, executable code is a Lisp object,
called a ``Function Entry Frame'' or ``FEF'' for historical reasons.  A FEF
contains the code for one function.  This is analogous to what Maclisp
calls a ``subr pointer''.  FEFs are produced by the Lisp Compiler
((compiler)), and are usually found as the definitions of symbols.  The
printed representation of a FEF includes its name so that it can be
identified.
	Another kind of Lisp object that represents executable code is
a ``microcode entry''.
These are the microcoded primitive functions of the Lisp system,
and any user functions compiled into microcode.

	About the only useful thing to do with any of these compiled code objects
is to 2apply* it to arguments.  However, some functions are
provided for examining such objects, for user convenience.  See
3arglist* ((arglist-fun)),
3args-info* ((args-info-fun)),
3describe* ((describe-fun)),
and 3disassemble* ((disassemble-fun)).

	A 2locative* (see (locative)) is a kind of a pointer to a single memory cell
anywhere in the system.  The contents of this cell can be accessed by 3cdr*
(see (cdr-fun)) and updated by 3rplacd* (see (rplacd-fun)).

	An 2array* (see (array))
is a set of cells indexed by a tuple of integer subscripts.
The contents of the cells may be accessed and changed individually.  There are several
types of arrays.  Some have cells that may contain any object, while others (numeric
arrays) may only contain small positive numbers.  Strings are a type of array;
the elements are character objects.

	A 2list* is not a primitive data type, but rather a data structure
made up out of conses and the symbol 3nil*.  See (list-and-tree).

.section Data Type Predicates
.cindex predicate
	A 2predicate* is a function that tests for some condition involving
its arguments and returns the symbol 3t* if the condition is true, or
the symbol 3nil* if it is not true.  The following predicates are for
testing what data type an object has.

	By convention, the names of predicates usually end in the letter `p' (which
stands for `predicate').
'c (See [section on naming conventions]).
.cindex naming convention

	The following predicates are for testing data types.  These predicates
return 3t* if the argument is of the type indicated by the name of the function,
3nil* if it is of some other type.
'cindex "data type"

.defun symbolp object
'cindex "symbol"
3t* if 2object* is a symbol, otherwise 3nil*.
.end_defun

.defun nsymbolp object
3nil* if 2object* is a symbol, otherwise 3t*.
.end_defun

.defun listp object
'cindex "cons"
3t* if 2object* is a cons, otherwise 3nil*.
Note that this means 3(listp nil)* is 3nil* even though 3nil* is the empty list.

[This may be changed in the future to work like 3cli:listp*.
Since the current definition of 3listp* is identical to that of 3consp*,
all uses of 3listp* should be changed to 3consp* unless the
treatment of 3nil* is not of concern.]
.end_defun

.defun cli:listp object
The Common Lisp version of 3listp* returns 3t* if 2object*
is 3nil* or a cons.
.end_defun

.defun nlistp object
3t* if 2object* is anything besides a cons,
otherwise 3nil*.  3(nlistp nil)* returns 3t*.

[This may be changed in the future, if and when 3listp* is changed.
Since the current definition of 3nlistp* is identical to that of 3atom*,
all uses of 3nlistp* should be changed to 3atom* unless the
treatment of 3nil* is not of concern.]
.end_defun

.defun atom object
'cindex "atom"
3t* if 2object* is not a cons,
otherwise 3nil*.  This is the same as 3(not (consp 2object*))*.
.end_defun

.defun consp object
3t* if 2object* is a cons, otherwise 3nil*.  At the
moment, this is the same as 3listp*; but while 3listp* may be
changed, 3consp* will 2never* be true of 3nil*.
.end_defun

.defun numberp object
'cindex "number"
3t* if 2object* is any kind of number,
otherwise 3nil*.
.end_defun

.defun integerp object
.defun1 fixp object
Return 3t* if 2object* is a representation of an integer, i.e. a
fixnum or a bignum, otherwise 3nil*.
.end_defun

.defun floatp object
3t* if 2object* is a floating-point number,
i.e. a full-size or short float, otherwise 3nil*.
.end_defun

.defun fixnump object
3t* if 2object* is a fixnum, otherwise 3nil*.
.end_defun

.defun bigp object
3t* if 2object* is a bignum, otherwise 3nil*.
.end_defun

.defun flonump object
3t* if 2object* is a full-size float, otherwise 3nil*.
.end_defun

.defun small-floatp object
3t* if 2object* is a short float, otherwise 3nil*.
.end_defun

.defun rationalp object
3t* if 2object* is an exact representation of a rational number;
that is, if it is a fixnum, a bignum or a ratio.  Otherwise 3nil*.
.end_defun

.defun complexp object
3t* if 2object* is a complexnum, a number explicitly
represented as complex.  Otherwise 3nil*.
.end_defun

.defun realp object
3t* if 2object* is a number whose value is real,
otherwise 3nil*.  Any fixnum, bignum, float (of either format) or
ratio satisfies this predicate.  So does a complexnum whose imaginary
part is zero.
.end_defun

.defun characterp object
3t* if 2object* is a character object, otherwise 3nil*.
.end_defun

.defun stringp object
'cindex "string"
3t* if 2object* is a string, otherwise 3nil*.
.end_defun

.defun arrayp object
'cindex "array"
3t* if 2object* is an array, otherwise 3nil*.
Note that strings are arrays.
.end_defun

.defun vectorp object
3t* if 2object* is an array of rank 1.
.end_defun

.defun bit-vector-p object
3t* if 2object* is an array of rank 1 that allows only 0 and 1 as elements.
.end_defun

.defun simple-vector-p object
3t* if 2object* is an array of rank 1, with no fill pointer and not displaced,
that can have any Lisp object as an element.
.end_defun

.defun simple-bit-vector-p object
3t* if 2object* is an array of rank 1, with no fill pointer and not displaced,
that allows only 0 and 1 as elements.
.end_defun

.defun simple-string-p object
3t* if 2object* is a string with no fill pointer and not displaced.
.end_defun

.defun functionp object &optional allow-special-forms
'cindex "function"
'cindex "applicable function"
3t* if 2object* is a function (essentially, something
that is acceptable as the first argument to 3apply*), otherwise 3nil*.
In addition to interpreted, compiled, and microcoded functions, 3functionp*
is true of closures, select-methods (see (select-method)), and symbols whose function
definition is 3functionp*.

3functionp* is not true of objects that can be called as functions but
are not normally thought of as functions: arrays, stack groups,
entities, and instances.  As a special case, 3functionp* of a symbol
whose function definition is an array returns 3t*, because in this
case the array is being used as a function rather than as an object.

If 2allow-special-forms* is specified and non-3nil*, then
3functionp* will be true of macros and special-form functions (those
with quoted arguments).  Normally 3functionp* returns 3nil* for
these since they do not behave like functions.
.end_defun

.defun compiled-function-p object
.defun1 subrp object
3t* if 2object* is any compiled code object, otherwise 3nil*.
The name 3subrp* is for Maclisp compatibility.
.end_defun

.defun special-form-p symbol
3t* if 2symbol* is defined as a function that takes some
unevaluated args.  Macros do not count as special forms.
.end_defun

3macro-function* can be used to test whether a symbol is defined as a
macro, but you must be careful because it also returns a non-3nil* value
for certain special forms.  See the definition 3macro-function*
((macro-function-fun)) to find out how to do this properly.

.defun closurep object
'cindex "closure"
3t* if 2object* is a closure, otherwise 3nil*.
.end_defun

.defun entityp object
'cindex "entity"
3t* if 2object* is an entity, otherwise 3nil*.
See (entity) for information about entities.
.end_defun

.defun locativep object
'cindex "locative"
3t* if 2object* is a locative, otherwise 3nil*.
.end_defun

.defun commonp object
3t* if 2object* is of a type that Common Lisp defines operations on.
See the type specifier 3common* ((common-type-spec)).
.end_defun

Other standard type predicates include 3packagep* (see (packagep-fun)),
3random-state-p* (see (random-state-p-fun)), 3hash-table-p*
((hash-table-p-fun)), 3pathnamep* ((pathnamep-fun)),
3streamp* ((streamp-fun)) and 3readtablep* ((readtablep-fun)).
3defstruct* can define additional type predicates automatically
((defstruct-predicates)).

.section Type Specifiers
.setq type-specifiers section-page
.cindex type specifiers

Data types can be represented symbolically by Lisp objects called 2type
specifiers*.  A type specifier describes a class of possible Lisp
objects; the function 3typep* tells whether a given object matches a
given type specifier.

Built-in type specifiers exist for the
actual Lisp Machine data types.  The user can define additional
type specifiers to represent arbitrary classifications of data.
Type specifiers can also be combined into specifiers for more
complex types.

Some type specifiers are symbols: for example, 3number*, 3cons*,
3symbol*, 3integer*, 3character*, 3compiled-function*,
3array*, 3vector*.  Their meanings are mostly obvious, but a table
follows below.  Type specifiers that are symbols are called 2simple*
type specifiers.

Lists can also be type specifiers.  They are usually combinations or
restrictions of other type specifiers.  The car of the list is the key
to understanding what it means.  An example of a combination is 3(or
array symbol)*, which matches any array or any symbol.  An example of a
restriction type is 3(integer 0 6)*, which matches only integers
between 0 and 6 (inclusive).

Restriction Types for Numbers

.table 3
.item (complex 2type-spec*)
complex numbers whose components match 2type-spec*.
Thus, 3(complex rational)* is the type of complex numbers with
rational components.  3(complex t)* is equivalent to 3complex*.

.item (integer 2low* 2high*)
integers between 2low* and 2high*.
2low* can be:
.table 3
.item 2integer*
2integer* is an inclusive lower limit
.item (2integer*)
2integer* is an exclusive lower limit.
.item *
There is no lower limit.
.end_table

2high* has the same sorts of possibilities.
If 2high* is omitted, it defaults to 3**.  If both 2low* and 2high* are omitted,
you have 3(integer)*, which is equivalent to plain 3integer*.  Examples:
.lisp
(integer 0 *)      1matches any nonnegative integer.*
(integer 0)        1matches any nonnegative integer.*
(integer -4 3)     1matches any integer between -4 and 3, inclusive.*
(integer -4 (4))   1matches any integer between -4 and 3, inclusive.*
.end_lisp
3bit* is equivalent to 3(integer 0 1)*.

.item (rational 2low* 2high*)
.item1 (float 2low* 2high*)
.item1 (short-float 2low* 2high*)
.item1 (single-float 2low* 2high*)
.item1 (double-float 2low* 2high*)
.item1 (long-float 2low* 2high*)
.item1 (noncomplex 2low* 2high*)
These specify restrictive bounds for the types 3rational*, 3float* and so on.
The bounds work on these types just the way they do on 3integer*.
Exclusive and inclusive bounds make a useful difference here:
.lisp
(float (-4) (3))    1matches any float between -4 and 3, exclusive.*
.end_lisp
No possible inclusive bounds could provide the same effect.

.item (mod 2high*)
nonnegative integers less than 2high*.  2high* should be an integer.
3(mod)*, 3(mod *)* and plain 3mod* are allowed, but are equivalent
to 3(integer 0)*.

.item (signed-byte 2size*)
integers that fit into a byte of 2size* bits, of which one bit is the sign bit.
3(signed-byte 4)* is equivalent to 3(integer -8 7)*.
3(signed-byte *)* and plain 3signed-byte* are equivalent to 3integer*.

.item (unsigned-byte 2size*)
nonnegative integers that fit into a byte of 2size* bits, with no sign bit.
3(unsigned-byte 3)* is equivalent to 3(integer 0 7)*.
3(unsigned-byte *)* and plain 3unsigned-byte* are equivalent to 3(integer 0)*.

Simple Types for Arrays

.table 3
.item array
all arrays.
.item simple-array
arrays that are not displaced and have no fill pointers.
(Displaced arrays are defined in (displaced-array) and fill pointers on (fill-pointer)).
.item vector
arrays of rank one.
.item bit-vector
3art-1b* arrays of rank one.

Restriction Types for Arrays

.table 3
.item (array 2element-type* 2dimensions*)
arrays whose
rank and dimensions fit the restrictions described by 2dimensions*
and whose nature restricts possible elements to match 2element-type*.

The array elements condition has nothing to do with the actual values of
the elements.  Rather, it is a question of whether the array's own type
permits exactly such elements as would match 2element-type*.  If
anything could be stored in the array that would not match
2element-type*, then the array does not match.  If anything that
would match 2element-type* could not be stored in the array, then the
array does not match.

For example, if 2element-type* is 3(signed-byte 4)*, the array must
be an 3art-4b* array.  An 3art-1b* array will not do, even though
its elements all do match 3(signed-byte 4)*, because some objects such
as the number 12 match 3(signed-byte 4)* but could not be stored in an
3art-1b* array.  Likewise an 3art-q* array whose elements all happen
to match 3(signed-byte 4)* will not do, since new elements such as
3nil* or 231 which fail to match could potentially be stored in the
array.

If 2element-type* is 3t*, the type to which all objects belong,
then the array must be one in which any object can be stored:
3art-q* or 3art-q-list*.

3** as 2element-type* means ``no restriction''.  Any type of
array is then allowed, whether it restricts its elements or not.

2dimensions* can be 3**, an integer or a list.
If it is 3**, the rank and dimensions are not restricted.
If it is an integer, it specifies the rank of the array.
Then any array of that rank matches.

If 2dimensions* is a list, its length specifies the rank,
and each element of 2dimensions* restricts one dimension.
If the element is an integer, that dimension's length must equal it.
If the element is *, that dimension's length is not restricted.

.item (simple-array 2element-type* 2dimensions*)
the restrictions work as in 3(array 2element-type* 2dimensions*)*,
but in addition the array must be a simple array.

.item (vector 2element-type* 2size*)
2element-type* works as above.  The array must be a vector.
2size* must be an integer or *;
if it is an integer, the array's length must equal 2size*.

.item (bit-vector 2size*)
.item1 (simple-vector 2size*)
.item1 (simple-bit-vector 2size*)
.item1 (string 2size*)
.item1 (simple-string 2size*)
These require the array to match type 3bit-vector*, 3simple-vector*, etc.
This implicitly restricts the element type, so there is no point
in allowing an 2element-type* to be given in the type specifier.
2size* works as in 3vector*.

All objects of types defined by Common Lisp.  This is all Lisp objects
except closures, entities, stack groups, locatives, instances,
select-methods, and compiled and microcode functions.  (A few kinds
of instances, such as pathnames, are 3common*, because Common Lisp does
define how to manipulate pathnames, and it is considered irrelevant that
the Lisp Machine happens to implement pathnames using instances.)
.item stream
Anything that looks like it might be a valid I/O stream.
It is impossible to tell for certain whether an object
is a stream, since any function with proper behavior
may be used as a stream.  Therefore, use of this
type specifier is discouraged.  It exists for the sake
of Common Lisp.

Combination Type Specifiers

.table 3
.item (member 2objects*)
any one of 2objects*, as compared with 3eql*.
Thus, 3(member t nil x)* is matched only by
3t*, 3nil* or 3x*.

.item (satisfies 2predicate*)
objects on which the function 2predicate* returns a non-3nil* value.
Thus, 3(satisfies numberp)* is equivalent
as a type specifier to 3number* (though the system could not tell that this is so).
2predicate* must be a symbol, not a 3lambda*-expression.

.item (and 2type-specs*...)
objecs that match all of the 2type-specs* individually.  Thus, 3(and
integer (satisfies oddp))* is the type of odd integers.

.item (or 2type-specs*...)
objects that match at least one of the 2type-specs* individually.
Thus, 3(or number array)* includes all numbers and all arrays.

.item (not 2type-spec*)
objects that do not match 2type-spec*.
.end_table

.subsection User-Defined Type Specifiers

.defmac deftype type-name lambda-list body...
Defines 2type-name* as a type specifier by providing code to expand it into
another type specifier--a sort of type specifier macro.

When a list starting with 2type-name* is encountered as a type
specifier, the 2lambda-list* is matched against the cdr of the type
specifier just as the lambda-list of an ordinary 3defmacro*-defined
macro is matched against the cdr of a form.  Then the 2body* is
executed and should return a new type specifier to be used instead of
the original one.

If there are optional arguments in 2lambda-list* for which no default value
is specified, they get 3** as a default value.

If 2type-name* by itself is encountered as a type specifier, it is
treated as if it were 3(2type-name*)*; that is to say, the
2lambda-list* is matched against no arguments and then the 2body*
is executed.  So each argument in the 2lambda-list* gets its
default value, and there is an error if they are not all optional.

.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(deftype vector (element-type size)
  `(array ,element-type (,size)))
1could have been used to define 3vector*.*

(deftype odd-natural-number-below (n)
  `(and (integer 0 (,n)) (satisfies oddp)))

(typep 5 '(odd-natural-number-below 6)) => t
(typep 7 '(odd-natural-number-below 6)) => nil
.end_lisp
.end_defmac

.subsection Testing Types with Type Specifiers

.defun type-of object
Returns a type specifier which 2object* matches.
Any given 2object* matches many different type specifiers,
including 3t*, so you should not attempt to rely on knowing
which type specifier would be returned for any particular object.
The one actually returned is chosen so as to be informative
for a human.  Programs should generally use 3typep* rather than 3type-of*.

See also 3data-type*, (data-type-fun).
.end_defun

.defun typep object type-spec
3t* if 2object* matches 2type-spec*.  The fundamental
purpose of type specifiers is to be used in 3typep* or other
functions and constructs that use 3typep*.  Examples:
.lisp
(typep 5 'number) => t
(typep 5 '(integer 0 7)) => t
(typep 5 'bit) => nil
(typep 5 'array) => nil
(typep "foo" 'array) => t
(typep nil 'list) => t
(typep '(a b) 'list) => t
(typep 'lose 'list) => nil
(typep 'x '(or symbol number)) => t
(typep 5 '(or symbol number)) => t
.end_lisp

If the value of 2type-spec* is known at compile time, the compiler
optimizes 3typep* so that it does not decode the argument at run
time.

In Maclisp, 3typep* is used with one argument.  It returns a symbol
describing the type of the object it is given.  This is somewhat like
what 3type-of* does, except in Maclisp the intention was to compare
the result with 3eq* to test the type of an object.  The Lisp Machine
supports this usage of 3typep* for compatibility, but the returned
symbol is a keyword (such as 3:list*, for conses) which makes it
actually incompatible.  This usage is considered obsolete and should
be removed from programs.
.end_defun

.defmac typecase key-form clauses...
Computes the value of 2key-form* and then executes one (or none) of
the 2clauses* according to the type of the value (call it 2key*).

Each clause starts with a type specifier, not evaluated, which
could be the second argument to 3typep*.  In fact, that is how it is used.
The rest of the clause is composed of forms.  The type specifiers of the
clauses are matched sequentially against 2key*.  If there is a match,
the rest of that clause is executed and the values of the last form in it
are returned from the 3typecase* form.  If no clause matches,
the 3typecase* form returns 3nil*.

3typecase*, like 3typep* is optimized carefully by the compiler.

Note that 3t*, the type specifier that matches all objects, is useful
in the last clause of a 3typecase*.  3otherwise* is also permitted
instead of 3t* by special dispensation, with the same meaning.

.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(typecase foo
  (symbol (get-pname foo))
  (string foo)
  (list (apply 'string-append (mapcar 'hack foo)))
  ((integer 0) (hack-positive-integer foo))
  (t (princ-to-string foo)))
.end_lisp
.end_defmac

.defmac etypecase key-form clauses...
Like 3typecase* except that an uncorrectable error is signaled if every clause fails.
3t* or 3otherwise* clauses are not allowed.
.end_defmac

.defmac ctypecase place clauses...
Like 3etypecase* except that the error is correctable.  The first
argument is called 2place* because it must be 3setf*'able (see
(setf-fun)).  If the user proceeds from the error, a new value is read
and stored into 2place*; then the clauses are tested again using the
new value.  Errors repeat until a value is specified that makes some
clause succeed.
.end_defmac

.subsection Coercion with Type Specifiers

.defun coerce object type-spec
Converts 2object* to an ``equivalent'' object that matches 2type-spec*.
Common Lisp specifies exactly which types can be converted to
which other types.  In general, a conversion that would lose information,
such as turning a float into an integer, is not allowed as a coercion.
Here is a complete list of types you can coerce to.

.table 3
.item complex
.item1 (complex 2type*)
Real numbers can be coerced to complex.  If a rational is coerced to
type 3complex*, the result equals the rational, and is not complex at
all.  This is because complex numbers with rational components are
canonicalized to real if possible.  However, if a rational is coerced to
3(complex float)* or 3(complex single-float)* then an actual complex
number does result.

It is permissible of course to coerce a complex number to a complex type.
The real and imaginary parts are coerced individually to 2type*
if 2type* is specified.

.item short-float
.item1 single-float
Rational numbers can be coerced to floating point numbers
and any kind of floating point number can be coerced to
any other floating point format.

.item float
Rational numbers are converted to 3single-float*'s;
floats of all kinds are left alone.

.item character
Strings of length one can be coerced to characters.
Symbols whose print-names have length one can also be.
An integer can be coerced to a character; this results in a
character whose character code is the specified integer.

.item list
Any vector can be coerced to type 3list*.
The resulting list has the same elements as the vector.

.item 13vector* or 3array* or any restricted array type.*
Any sequence (list or vector) can be coerced to any array or vector type.
The new array has rank one and the same elements as the original sequence.

If you specify a type of array with restricted element type, you may
actually get an array which can hold other kinds of things as well.  For
example, the Lisp Machine does not provide anything of type 3(array
symbol)*, but if you specify that, you will get an array which at least
can hold symbols (but can hold other things as well).  If an element of
the original sequence does not fit in the new array, an error is
signaled.

.item t
Any object can be coerced to type 3t*, without change
to the object.
.end_table

If the value of 2type-spec* is known at compile time, the compiler
optimizes 3coerce* so that it does not decode the argument at run
time.
.end_defun

.subsection Comparing Type Specifiers

Since a type describes a set of possible objects, it is possible
to ask whether one type is contained in another type.  Another way
to say this is, is one type a 2subtype* of another?

.defun subtypep type1 type2
3t* if 2type1* is a subtype of 2type2*.

The system cannot always tell whether 2type1* is a subtype of
2type2*.  When 3satisfies* type specifiers are in use, this question
is mathematically undecidable.  Because of this, it has not been
considered worthwhile to make the system able to answer obscure subtype
questions even when that is theoretically possible.  If the answer is
not known, 3subtypep* returns 3nil*.

Thus, 3nil* could mean that 2type1* is certainly not a subtype of
2type2*, or it could mean that there is no way to tell whether it is a
subtype.  3subtypep* returns a second value to distinguish these two
situations: the second value is 3t* if 3subtypep*'s first value is
definitive, 3nil* if the system does not know the answer.

Examples:
.lisp
(subtypep 'cons 'list) => t t
(subtypep 'null 'list) => t t
(subtypep 'symbol 'list) => nil t

(subtypep 'list 'number) => nil t
1because not all lists are numbers (in fact, no lists are numbers).*

(subtypep 'number 'rational) => nil t
1because not all numbers are rational.*

(subtypep '(satisfies foo) '(satisfies bar)) => nil nil
1because the system does not attempt to figure out your code*.
