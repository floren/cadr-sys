This chapter discusses the symbol as a Lisp data type.  The Lisp system uses
symbols as variables and function names, but these applications of symbols
are discussed in chapter (evaluator-chapter).

.section The Value Cell
.cindex value cell
	Each symbol has associated with it a 2value cell*, which refers to
one Lisp object.  This object is called the symbol's 2value*, since it is
what you get when you evaluate the symbol as a dynamic variable in a program.
Variables and how they work are described in (variable-section).  We also say
the the symbol 2is bound to* the object which is its value.  The symbols
3nil* and 3t* are always bound to themselves; they may not be assigned,
bound, or otherwise used as variables.  The same is true of symbols in the
keyword package.

	The value cell can also be 2void*, referring to 2no* Lisp object,
in which case the symbol is said to be void or 2unbound*.  This is the
initial state of a symbol when it is created.  An attempt to evaluate a
void symbol causes an error.

Lexical variable bindings are not stored in symbol value cells.
The functions in this section have no interaction with lexical bindings.

.defun symeval symbol
.defun1 symbol-value symbol
3symeval* is the basic primitive for retrieving a symbol's value.
3(symeval 2symbol*)* returns 2symbol*'s current binding.
This is the function called by 3eval* when it is given a symbol to
evaluate.  If the symbol is unbound, then 3symeval* signals an
error.  3symbol-value* is the Common Lisp name for this function.
.end_defun

.defun set symbol value
3set* is the primitive for assignment of symbols.  The 2symbol*'s value
is changed to 2value*; 2value* may be any Lisp object.  3set* returns
2value*.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(set (cond ((eq a b) 'c)
           (t 'd))
     'foo)
.end_lisp
either sets 3c* to 3foo* or sets 3d* to 3foo*.

3(setf (symeval 2symbol*) 2value*)* is a more modern
way to do this.
.end_defun

.defun boundp symbol
3t* if 2symbol*'s value cell is not void.
.end_defun

.defun makunbound symbol
Makes 2symbol*'s value cell void.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(setq a 1)
a => 1
(makunbound 'a)
a => 1causes an error.*
.end_lisp
3makunbound* returns its argument.
.end_defun

.defun value-cell-location symbol
Returns a locative pointer to 2symbol*'s value cell.
See the section on locatives ((locative)).  It is preferable to write
.lisp
(locf (symeval 2symbol*))
.end_lisp
which is equivalent, instead of calling this function explicitly.

This is actually the internal value cell; there can also be an external
value cell.  For details, see the section on closures ((closure)).

For historical compatibility, 3value-cell-location* of a quoted symbol is
recognized specially by the compiler and treated like 3variable-location*
((variable-location-fun)).  However, such usage results in a compiler warning,
and eventually this compatibility feature will be removed.
.end_defun

.section The Function Cell
.cindex function cell
	Every symbol also has associated with it a 2function cell*.  The 2function*
cell is similar to the 2value* cell; it refers to a Lisp object.
When a function is referred to by name, that is, when a symbol is passed to 3apply*
or appears as the car of a form to be evaluated, that symbol's function cell
is used to find its 2definition*, the functional object which is to be applied.
For example, when evaluating 3(+ 5 6)*, 
the evaluator looks in 3+*'s function cell to find the definition of 3+*,
in this case a compiled function object, to apply to 5 and 6.
	Maclisp does not have function cells; instead, it looks for special
properties on the property list.  This is one of the major incompatibilities
between the two dialects.
	Like the value cell, a function cell can be void, and it can be bound
or assigned.  (However, to bind a function cell you must use the
3%bind* subprimitive; see (%bind-fun).)
The following functions are analogous to the value-cell-related
functions in the previous section.

.defun fsymeval symbol
.defun1 symbol-function symbol
Returns 2symbol*'s definition, the contents of its
function cell.  If the function cell is void, 3fsymeval*
signals an error.  3symbol-function* is the Common Lisp name for this function.
.end_defun

.defun fset symbol definition
Stores 2definition*, which may be any Lisp object, into 2symbol*'s
function cell.  It returns 2definition*.

3(setf (fsymeval 2symbol*) 2definition*)* is a more modern
way to do this.
.end_defun

.defun fboundp symbol
3nil* if 2symbol*'s function cell is void,
i.e. if 2symbol* is undefined.
Otherwise it returns 3t*.
.end_defun

.defun fmakunbound symbol
Causes 2symbol* to be undefined, i.e. its
function cell to be void.
It returns 2symbol*.
.end_defun

.defun function-cell-location symbol
Returns a locative pointer to 2symbol*'s
function cell.  See the section on locatives ((locative)).  It is
preferable to write
.lisp
(locf (fsymeval 2symbol*))
.end_lisp
rather than calling this function explicitly.
.end_defun

Since functions are the basic building block of Lisp programs,
the system provides a variety of facilities for dealing with functions.
Refer to chapter (function-chapter) for details.

.section The Property List
.setq symbol-plist-section section-page

Every symbol has an associated property list.  See (plist) for
documentation of property lists.  When a symbol is created, its property
list is initially empty.

The Lisp language itself does not use a symbol's property list for
anything.  (This was not true in older Lisp implementations, where the
print-name, value-cell, and function-cell of a symbol were kept on its
property list.)  However, various system programs use the property list to
associate information with the symbol.  For instance, the editor uses
the property list of a symbol which is the name of a function to
remember where it has the source code for that function, and the
compiler uses the property list of a symbol which is the name of a
special form to remember how to compile that special form.

Because of the existence of print-name, value, function, and package cells,
none of the Maclisp system property names (3expr*, 3fexpr*, 3macro*, 3array*,
3subr*, 3lsubr*, 3fsubr*, and in former times 3value* and
3pname*) exist in Zetalisp.

.defun plist symbol
.defun1 symbol-plist
Returns the list which represents the property list of 2symbol*.
Note that this is not actually a property list; you cannot do 3get*
on it.  This value is like what would be the cdr of a property list.

3symbol-plist* is the Common Lisp name.
.end_defun

.defun setplist symbol list
Sets the list which represents the property list of 2symbol* to 2list*.
3setplist* is to be used with caution (or not at all),
since property lists sometimes contain internal system properties, which
are used by many useful system functions.  Also it is inadvisable to have the property
lists of two different symbols be 3eq*, since the shared list structure will
cause unexpected effects on one symbol if 3putprop* or 3remprop* is done to the other.

3setplist* is equivalent to
.lisp
(setf (plist 2symbol*) 2list*)
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun property-cell-location symbol
Returns a locative pointer to the location of 2symbol*'s
property-list cell.  This locative pointer may be passed to 3get* or
3putprop* with the same results as if as 2symbol* itself had been
passed.  It is preferable to write
.lisp
(locf (plist 2symbol*))
.end_lisp
rather than using this function.
.end_defun

.section The Print Name
.cindex print name
Every symbol has an associated string called the 2print-name*, or 2pname*
for short.  This string is used as the external representation of the symbol:
if the string is typed in to 3read*, it is read as a reference to that symbol
(if it is interned), and if the symbol is printed, 3print* types out the
print-name.

If a symbol is uninterned, 7#:* is normally printed as a prefix
before the symbol's print-name.  If the symbol is interned, a package
prefix may be printed, depending on the current package and how it relates
to the symbol's home package.

For more information, see the sections on the 2reader*
(see (reader)), 2printer* (see (printer)), and packages
(see (package)).

.defun symbol-name symbol
.defun1 get-pname symbol
Returns the print-name of the symbol 2symbol*.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(symbol-name 'xyz) => "XYZ"
.end_lisp
3get-pname* is an older name for this function.
.end_defun

.section The Package Cell

Every symbol has a 2package cell* which, for interned
symbols, is used to point to the package which the symbol belongs to.  For an
uninterned symbol, the package cell contains 3nil*.  For
information about packages in general, see the chapter on packages, (package).
For information about package cells, see (symbol-package-cell-discussion).

.section Creating Symbols

The functions in this section are primitives for creating symbols.
However, before discussing them, it is important to point out that most
symbols are created by a higher-level mechanism, namely the reader and
the 3intern* function.  Nearly all symbols in Lisp are created
by virtue of the reader's having seen a sequence of input characters that
looked like the printed representation (p.r.) of a symbol.  When the
reader sees such a p.r., it calls 3intern* (see (intern-fun)),
which looks up the sequence of characters in a big table and sees whether any symbol
with this print-name already exists.  If it does, 3read* uses the
already-existing symbol.  If it does not, then 3intern* creates a new
symbol and puts it into the table; 3read* uses that new symbol.

A symbol that has been put into such a table is called an 2interned*
symbol.  Interned symbols are normally created automatically; the first
time that someone (such as the reader) asks for a symbol with a given
print-name, that symbol is automatically created.

These tables are called 2packages*.  For more information, turn
to the chapter on packages ((package)).

.cindex uninterned symbol
An 2uninterned* symbol is a symbol that has not been recorded
or looked up in a package.  It is used simply as a data object,
with no special cataloging.  An uninterned symbol prints with a
prefix 7#:* when escaping is in use, unless 3*print-gensym** is 3nil*.
This allows uninterned symbols to be distinguishable and to read back in as
uninterned symbols.  See (*print-gensym*-var).

The following functions can be used to create uninterned symbols
explicitly.

.defun make-symbol pname &optional permanent-p
Creates a new uninterned symbol, whose print-name is the string
2pname*.  The value and function cells are void and the
property list is empty.  If 2permanent-p* is specified, it is
assumed that the symbol is going to be interned and probably kept around
forever; in this case it and its pname are put in the proper areas.
If 2permanent-p* is 3nil* (the default), the symbol goes in the
default area and the pname is not copied.  2permanent-p* is mostly
for the use of 3intern* itself.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Examples:
(setq a (make-symbol "foo")) => foo
(symeval a) => ERROR!
.end_lisp
Note that the symbol is 2not* interned; it is simply created and returned.
.end_defun

.defun copysymbol symbol copy-props
.defun1 copy-symbol symbol copy-props
Returns a new uninterned symbol with the same print-name
as 2symbol*.  If 2copy-props* is non-3nil*, then the
value and function-definition of the new symbol are
the same as those of 2symbol*, and the property list of
the new symbol is a copy of 2symbol*'s.  If 2copy-props*
is 3nil*, then the new symbol's function and value are void, and
its property list is empty.
.end_defun

.defun gensym &optional x
Invents a print-name and creates a new symbol with that print-name.
It returns the new, uninterned symbol.

	The invented print-name is a prefix (the value of 3si:*gensym-prefix*)
followed by the decimal representation of a number (the value of 3si:*gensym-counter*),
e.g. 3g0001*.  The number is increased by one every time 3gensym* is called.

	If the argument 2x* is present and is a fixnum, then 3si:*gensym-counter* is
set to 2x*.  If 2x* is a string or a symbol, then 3si:*gensym-prefix* is set to it,
so it becomes the prefix for this and successive calls to 3gensym*.
After handling the argument, 3gensym* creates a symbol as it would with no argument.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Examples:
1if*	(gensym) => #:g0007
1then*	(gensym 'foo) => #:foo0008
	(gensym 32.) => #:foo0032
	(gensym) => #:foo0033
.end_lisp
	Note that the number is in decimal and always has four digits.
7#:* is the prefix normally printed before uninterned symbols.

	3gensym* is usually used to create a symbol which should not normally
be seen by the user, and whose print-name is unimportant, except to
allow easy distinction by eye between two such symbols.
The optional argument is rarely supplied.
The name comes from `generate symbol', and the symbols produced by it
are often called ``gensyms''.
.end_defun

.defun gentemp &optional (prefix 3"t"*) (a-package 3package*)
Creates and returns a new symbol whose name starts with 2prefix*,
interned in 2a-package*, and distinct from any symbol already present
there.  This is done by trying names one by one until a name not already
in use is found, which may be very slow.
.end_defun
