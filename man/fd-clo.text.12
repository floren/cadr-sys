	A 2closure* is a type of Lisp functional object useful
for implementing certain advanced access and control structures.
Closures give you more explicit control over the
environment by allowing you to save the dynamic bindings of specified
variables and then to refer to those bindings later, even after
the construct (3let*, etc.) which made the bindings has been exited.

.section What a Closure Is

	There is a view of dynamic variable binding that we use in this
section because it makes it easier to explain what closures do.  In this
view, when a variable is bound dynamically, a new binding is created for
it.  The old binding is saved away somewhere and is inaccessible.  Any
references to the variable then get the contents of the new
binding, and any 3setq*'s change the contents of the new value
cell.  Evantually the new binding goes away, and the old binding, along
with its contents, becomes current again.

	For example, consider the following sequence of Lisp forms:

.lisp
(defvar a 3)		;1 3a* becomes 3.*

(let ((a 10))		;1 3a* rebound to 10.*
  (print (+ a 6)))      ;1 16 is printed.*

(print a)		;1 3 is printed.*
.end_lisp

Initially there is a binding for 3a*, and the 3setq* form makes the
contents of that binding be 33*.  Then the 3lambda*-combination is
evaluated.  3a* is bound to 310*: the old binding, which still
contains 33*, is saved away, and a new binding is created with
310* as its contents.  The reference to 3a* inside the 3lambda*
expression evaluates to the current binding of 3a*, which is the
contents of its current binding, namely 310*.  So 316* is printed.
Then the newer binding is discarded and the old binding, which still
contains a 33*, is restored.  The final 3print* prints 33*.

	The form 3(closure 2var-list* 2function*)*, where
2var-list* is a list of variables and 2function* is any function,
creates and returns a closure.  When this closure is applied to some
arguments, all of the bindings of the variables on 2var-list* are
saved away, and the bindings that those variables had 2at the time
3closure* was called* (that is, at the time the closure was created)
are made to be the bindings of the symbols.  Then 2function* is
applied to the arguments.  (This paragraph is somewhat complex, but it
completely describes the operation of closures; if you don't understand
it, come back and read it again after reading the next two paragraphs.)

	Here is another, lower-level explanation.  The closure object
stores several things inside it.  First, it saves the 2function*.
Secondly, for each variable in 2var-list*, it remembers what that
variable's binding was when the closure was created.
Then when the closure is called as a function, it first temporarily restores
the bindings it has remembered inside the closure, and then applies 2function* to the
same arguments to which the closure itself was applied.  When the function
returns, the bindings are restored to be as they were before the closure
was called.

	Now, if we evaluate the form
.lisp
(setq a 
      (let ((x 3))
	(declare (special x))
	(closure '(x) 'frob)))
.end_lisp
what happens is that a new binding is created for 3x*, containing
a fixnum 33*.  Then a closure is created, which remembers
the function 3frob*, the symbol 3x*, and that binding.
Finally the old binding of 3x* is restored, and the closure is
returned.  Notice that the new binding is still around, because
it is still known about by the closure.  When the closure is applied,
say by doing 3(funcall a 7)*,
this binding is temporarily restored and the value of 3x* is 33*
again.  If 3frob* uses 3x* as a free variable, it sees 33*
as the value.

	A closure can be made around any function, using any form that
evaluates to a function.  The form could evaluate to a compiled
function, as would 3(function (lambda () x))*.  In the example above,
the form is 3'frob* and it evaluates to the symbol 3frob*.  A symbol
is also a good function.  It is usually better to close around a symbol
that is the name of the desired function, so that the closure points to
the symbol.  Then, if the symbol is redefined, the closure will use the
new definition.  If you actually prefer that the closure continue to use
the old definition that was current when the closure was made,
use 3function*, as in:
.lisp
(closure '(x) (function frob))
.end_lisp

	Explicit closures made with 3closure* record only the dynamic
bindings of the specified variables.  Another closure mechanism is
activated automatically to record lexical bindings whenever 3function*
is used around an explicit lambda expression, but 3closure* itself has
no interaction with lexical bindings.

It is the user's responsibility to make sure that the bindings that the
closure is intended to record are dynamic bindings, either by means of
special declarations (see (declare-fun)) as shown above or by making the variables
globally special with 3defvar* or equivalent.  If the function closed over is an
explicit lambda expression, it is occasionally necessary to use declarations
within it to make sure that the variables are considered special there.
But this is not needed if the variables are globally special or if
a special declaration is lexically visible where 3closure* is called.

Usually the compiler can tell when a special declaration is missing, but
when making a closure the compiler detects this only after acting on the
assumption that the variable is lexical, by which time it is too late to
fix things.  The compiler warns you if this happens.

	In Zetalisp's implementation of closures, lambda-binding never
really allocates any storage to create new bindings.  Bindings receive
separate storage only when the 3closure* function itself finds they
need it.  Thus, there is no cost associated with closures when they
are not in use.

	Zetalisp closures differ from the closures of Lisp 1.5 (which were
made with 3function*)
in that they save specific variables rather than the entire
variable-binding environment.  For their intended applications, this is
an advantage.  The explicit declaration of the variables in 3closure*
permits higher efficiency and more flexibility.  In addition the program
is clearer because the intended effect of the closure is made manifest
by listing the variables to be affected.  Lisp 1.5 closures are more similar
to Zetalisp's automatic handling of lexical variables.

.cindex internal value cell
.cindex external value cell
.setq external-value-cell page
.setq internal-value-cell page
Closure implementation (which it not usually necessary for you to
understand) involves two kinds of value cells.  Every symbol has an
2internal value cell*, part of the symbol itself, which is where its
dynamic value is normally stored.  When a variable is closed over, it
gets an 2external value cell* to hold its value.  The external value
cells behave according to the lambda-binding model used earlier in this
section.  The value in the external value cell is found through the
usual access mechanisms (such as evaluating the symbol, calling
3symeval*, etc.), because the internal value cell is made to contain a
forwarding pointer to the external value cell that is current.  Such a
forwarding pointer is present in a symbol's value cell whenever its
current binding is being remembered by some closure; at other times,
there won't be an invisible pointer, and the value resides directly in
the symbol's internal value cell.

.section Examples of the Use of Closures

One thing we can do with closures is to implement a 2generator*, which
is a kind of function which is called successively to obtain successive elements
of a sequence.
We implement a function 3make-list-generator*, which takes a list
and returns a generator that returns successive
elements of the list.  When it gets to the end it should return 3nil*.

	The problem is that in between calls to the generator, the generator
must somehow remember where it is up to in the list.  Since all of its
bindings are undone when it is exited, it cannot save this information in
a bound variable.  It could save it in a global variable, but the problem
is that if we want to have more than one list generator at a time, they
will all try to use the same global variable and get in each other's way.

	Here is how to solve this problem using closures:
.lisp
(defun make-list-generator (l)
    (declare (special l))
    (closure '(l)
	     #'(lambda ()
		 (prog1 (car l)
		        (setq l (cdr l))))))
.end_lisp
3(make-list-generator '(1 2 3))* returns a generator which, on successive
calls, returns 1, 2, 3, and 3nil*.

Now we can make as many list generators as we like; they won't get
in each other's way because each has its own binding for 3l*.
Each of these bindings was created when the 3make-list-generator*
function was entered, and the bindings are remembered by the closures.

The following example uses closures which share bindings:
.lisp
(defvar a)
(defvar b)

(defun foo () (setq a 5))

(defun bar () (cons a b))

(let ((a 1) (b 1))
   (setq x (closure '(a b) 'foo))
   (setq y (closure '(a b) 'bar)))
.end_lisp

When the 3let* is entered, new bindings are created for the symbols
3a* and 3b*, and two closures are created that both point to those
bindings.  If we do 3(funcall x)*, the function 3foo* is
be run, and it changes the contents of the remembered binding
of 3a* to 35*.  If we then do 3(funcall y)*, the function 3bar*
returns 3(5 . 1)*.  This shows that the binding of 3a* seen
by the closure 3y* is the same binding seen by the closure 3x*.  The
top-level binding of 3a* is unaffected.

Here is how we can create a function that prints always using base 16:
.lisp
(deff print-in-base-16
      (let ((*print-base* 16.))
        (closure '(*print-base*) 'print)))
.end_lisp

.section Closure-Manipulating Functions

.defun closure var-list function
Creates and returns a closure of 2function* over the variables
in 2var-list*.  Note that all variables on 2var-list*
must be declared special if the function is to compile correctly.
.end_defun

To test whether an object is a closure, use the 3closurep* predicate
(see (closurep-fun)) or 3(typep 2object* 'closure)*.

.defun symeval-in-closure closure symbol
Returns the binding of 2symbol* in the environment of 2closure*;
that is, it returns what you would get if you restored the bindings
known about by 2closure* and then evaluated 2symbol*.
This allows you to ``look around inside'' a closure.
If 2symbol* is not closed over by 2closure*, this is just like 3symeval*.

2symbol* may be a locative pointing to a value cell instead of a
symbol (this goes for all the whatever-in-closure functions).
.end_defun

.defun set-in-closure closure symbol x
Sets the binding of 2symbol* in the environment of 2closure*
to 2x*; that is, it does what would happen if you restored the bindings
known about by 2closure* and then set 2symbol* to 2x*.
This allows you to change the contents of the bindings known about
by a closure.
If 2symbol* is not closed over by 2closure*, this is just like 3set*.
.end_defun

.defun locate-in-closure closure symbol
Returns the location of the place in 2closure* where the saved
value of 2symbol* is stored.  An equivalent form is
3(locf (symeval-in-closure 2closure* 2symbol*))*.
.end_defun

.defun boundp-in-closure closure symbol
Returns 3t* if 2symbol*'s binding in 2closure* is not void.
This is what 3(boundp 2symbol*)* would return if executed in
2closure*'s saved environment.
.end_defun

.defun makunbound-in-closure closure symbol
Makes 2symbol*'s binding in 2closure* be void.
This is what 3(makunbound 2symbol*)* would do if executed in
2closure*'s saved environment.
.end_defun

.defun closure-alist closure
Returns an alist of 3(2symbol* . 2value*)* pairs describing the
bindings that the closure performs when it is called.  This list is not
the same one that is actually stored in the closure; that one contains
pointers to value cells rather than symbols, and 3closure-alist*
translates them back to symbols so you can understand them.  As a result,
clobbering part of this list does not change the closure.

The list that is returned may contain void cells if some of the
closed-over variables were void in the closure's environment.
In this case, printing the value will get an error (accessing a cell
that contains a void marker is always an error unless done in a
special, careful way) but the value can still be passed around.
.end_defun

.defun closure-variables closure
Returns a list of variables closed over in 2closure*.  This is
3equal* to the first argument specified to the function 3closure*
when this closure was created.
.end_defun

.defun closure-function closure
Returns the closed function from 2closure*.  This is the function
that was the second argument to 3closure* when the closure was
created.
.end_defun

.defun closure-bindings closure
Returns the actual list of bindings to be performed when 2closure* is entered.
This list can be passed to 3sys:%using-binding-instances*
to enter the closure's environment without calling the closure.
See (sys:%using-binding-instances-fun).
.end_defun

.defun copy-closure closure
Returns a new closure that has the same function and variable values as
2closure*.  The bindings are not shared between the old closure and
the new one, so that if the old closure changes some closed variable's
values, the values in the new closure do not change.
.end_defun

.defmac let-closed ((variable value)...) function
When using closures, it is very common to bind a set of variables with
initial values only in order to make a closure over those variables.
Furthermore, the variables must be declared special.  3let-closed* is
a special form which does all of this.  It is best described by example:
.lisp
(let-closed ((a 5) b (c 'x))
   (function (lambda () ...)))
1macro-expands into*
(let ((a 5) b (c 'x))
  (declare (special a b c))
  (closure '(a b c)
    (function (lambda () ...))))
.end_lisp

Note that the following code, which would often be useful, does not work
as intended if 3x* is not special outside the 3let-closed*:
.lisp
(let-closed ((x x))
  (function ...))
.end_lisp
This is because the reference to 3x* as an initialization for the new
binding of 3x* is affected by the special declaration that the
3let-closed* produces.  It therefore does not see any lexical binding
of 3x*.  This behavior is unfortunate, but it is required by the
Common Lisp specifications.  To avoid the problem, write
.lisp
(let ((y x))
  (let-closed ((x y))
    (function ...)))
.end_lisp
or simply change the name of the variable outside the 3let-closed*
to something other than 3x*.
.end_defmac

.section Entities
.setq entity section-page
.setq flavor-entity section-page
.cindex entity
An entity is almost the same thing as a closure; an entity behaves just
like a closure when applied, but it has a recognizably different data
type which allows certain parts of the system such as the printer and
3describe* to treat it differently.  A closure is simply a kind of
function, but an entity is assumed to be a message-receiving object.
Thus, when the Lisp printer (see (printer)) is given a closure, it
prints a simple textual representation, but when it is handed an entity,
it sends the entity a 3:print-self* message, which the entity is
expected to handle.  The 3describe* function (see (describe-fun))
also sends entities messages when it is handed them.  So when you want
to make a message-receiving object out of a closure, as described on
(entity-usage), you should use an entity instead.

To a large degree, entities are made obsolete by flavors (see (flavor)).
Flavors have had considerably more attention paid to their efficiency and
to good tools for using them.  If what you are doing is flavor-like, it
is better to use flavors.

.defun entity variable-list function
Returns a newly constructed entity.  This function is just like the
function 3closure* except that it returns an entity instead of a
closure.

The 2function* argument should be a symbol which has a function
definition and a value.  When 3typep* is applied to this entity, it
returns the value of that symbol.
.end_defun

To test whether an object is an entity, use the 3entityp* predicate
(see (entityp-fun)).  The functions 3symeval-in-closure*,
3closure-alist*, 3closure-function*, etc. also operate on entities.
