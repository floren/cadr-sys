.cindex printed representation

	People cannot deal directly with Lisp objects, because the
objects live inside the machine.  In order to let us get at and talk
about Lisp objects, Lisp provides a representation of objects in the
form of printed text; this is called the 2printed representation*.
This is what you have been seeing in the examples throughout this manual.
Functions such as 3print*, 3prin1*,  and 3princ* take a Lisp
object and send the characters of its printed representation to a
stream.  These functions (and the internal functions they call) are
known as the 2printer*.  The 3read* function takes characters from a stream,
interprets them as a printed representation of a Lisp object, builds a
corresponding object, and returns it.  It and related functions are known as the 2reader*.
(Streams are explained in (streams).)

For the rest of the chapter, the phrase `printed representation' is
abbreviated as `p.r.'

.section What the Printer Produces
.setq printer section-page
.cindex printer
	The printed representation of an object depends on its type.  In
this section, we consider each type of object and explain how it is
printed.  There are several variables which you can set before calling
the printer to control how certain kinds of objects print.  They are
mentioned where relevant in this section and summarized in the following
section, but one of them is so important it must be described now.  This
is the 2escaping* feature, controlled by the value of
3*print-escape**.

.setq escaping page
.cindex escaping
Escaping means printing extra syntactical delimiters and 2escape characters*
when necessary to avoid ambiguity.  Without escaping, a symbol is
printed by printing the contents of its name; therefore, the symbol
whose name consists of the three characters 31*, 3.* and 35*
prints just like the floating point number 31.5*.  Escaping causes the symbol to
print as 3|1.5|* to differentiate the two.  3|* is a kind of escape
character; see (escape-characters) for more information on escape
characters and what they mean syntactically.

Escaping also involves printing package prefixes for symbols, printing
double-quotes or suitable delimiters around the contents of strings,
pathnames, host names, editor buffers, condition objects, and many other
things.  For example, without escaping, the pathname 3SYS: SYS; QCP1 LISP* prints as
exactly those characters.  The string with those contents prints indistinguishably.
With escaping, the pathname prints as 
.lisp
#FS:LOGICAL-PATHNAME "SYS: SYS; QCP1 LISP"
.end_lisp
and the string prints as 3"SYS: SYS; QCP1 LISP"*.

The non-escaped version is nicer looking in general, but if you give it
to 3read* it won't do the right thing.  The escaped version is
carefully set up so that 3read* will be able to read it in.  Printing
with escaping is useful in writing expressions into files.  Printing without
escaping is useful when constructing messages for the user.  However, when the purpose
of a message printed for the user is to 2mention* an object,
the object should be printed with escaping:
.lisp
Your output is in the file SYS: SYS; QCP1 QFASL.
.exdent 96 vs
Expected pathname properties missing from
 #FS:LOGICAL-PATHNAME "SYS: SYS; QCP1 LISP".
.end_lisp

.cindex Common Lisp syntax
.cindex traditional syntax

The printed representation of an object also may depend on whether
Common Lisp syntax is in use.  Common Lisp syntax and traditional
Zetalisp syntax are incompatible in some aspects of their specifications.  In order to
print objects so that they can be read back in, the printer needs to
know which syntax rules the reader will use.  This decision is based on
the current readtable: the value of 3*readtable** at the time printing
is done.

Now we describe how each type of object is standardly printed.

Integers:

For an integer (a fixnum or a bignum): the printed representation
consists of
.table 1 0 300
.item *
a possible radix prefix
.item *
a minus sign, if the number is negative
.item *
the representation of the number's absolute value
.item *
a possible radix suffix.
.end_table

The radix used for printing the number's absolute value
is found as the value of 3*print-base**.  This should be either
a positive fixnum or a symbol with an 3si:princ-function* property.
In the former case, the number is simply printed in that radix.
In the latter case, the property is called as a function with two
arguments, minus the absolute value of the number, and the stream
to print on.  The property is responsible for all printing.
If the value of 3*print-base** is unsuitable, an error is signaled.

A radix prefix or suffix is used if either 3*nopoint* is 3nil*
and the radix used is ten, or if 3*nopoint* is non-3nil* and
3*print-radix** is non-3nil*.  For radix ten, a period is used
as the suffix.  For any other radix, a prefix of the form
7#2radix*r* is used.  A radix prefix or suffix is useful
to make sure that 3read* parses the number using the same
radix used to print it, or for reminding the user how to interpret
the number.

.need 1800
.nopara
Ratios:

The printed representation of a ratio consists of
.table 1 0 300
.item *
a possible radix prefix
.item *
a minus sign, if the number is negative
.item *
the numerator
.item *
a ratio delimiter
.item *
the denominator
.end_table

If Common Lisp syntax is in use, the ratio delimiter is a slash (3/*).
If traditional syntax is in use, backslash (3\*) is used.  The
numerator and denominator are printed according to 3*print-base**.

The condition for printing a radix prefix is the same as for integers,
but a prefix 7#10r* is used to indicate radix ten, rather than a
period suffix.

.need 1800
.nopara
Floating Point Numbers:

.table 1 0 300
.item *
a minus sign, if the number is negative
.item *
one or more decimal digits
.item *
a decimal point
.item *
one or more decimal digits
.item *
an exponent, if the number is small enough or large enough to require one.
The exponent, if present, consists of
.table 1 0 300
.item *
a delimiter, the letter 3e*, 3s* or 3f*
.item *
a minus sign, if the exponent is negative
.item
one to three decimal digits
.end_table
.end_table

The number of digits printed is just enough to represent all the
significant mantissa bits the number has.  Feeding the p.r. of a float
back to the reader is always supposed to produce an equal float.
Floats are always printed in decimal; they are not affected by escaping
or by 3*print-base**, and there are never any radix prefixes or
suffixes.

The Lisp Machine supports two floating point number formats.  At any
time, one of them is the default; this is controlled by the value of
3*read-default-float-format**.  When a floating point number whose
format is 2not* currently the default is printed, it must be printed
with an exponent so that the exponent delimiter can specify the format.
The exponent is introduced in this case by 3f* or 3s* to specify the
format.  To the reader, 3f* specifies 3single-float* format and
3s* specifies 3short-float* format.

A floating point number of the default format is printed with no exponent
if this looks nice; namely, if this does not require too many extra zeros
to be printed before or after the decimal point.  Otherwise, an exponent
is printed and is delimited with 3e*.  To the reader, 3e* means
`use the default format'.

Normally the default float format is 3single-float*.  Therefore, the
printer may print full size floats without exponents or with 3e*
exponents, but short floats are always printed with exponents
introduced by 3s* so as to tell the reader to make a short float.

.need 1800
.nopara
Complex Numbers:

The traditional printed representation of a complex number consists of
.table 1 0 300
.item *
the real part
.item *
a plus sign, if the imaginary part is positive
.item *
the imaginary part
.item *
the letter 3i*, printed in lower case
.end_table

If the imaginary part is negative, the 3+* is omitted since the initial 3-*
of the imaginary part serves to separate it from the real part.

In Common Lisp syntax, a complex number is printed as 7#C(2realpart*
2imagpart*)*; for example, 3#C(5 3)*.  Common Lisp inexplicably
does not allow the more natural 35+3i* syntax.

The real and imaginary parts are printed individually according to the
specifications above.
.need 1800
.nopara
Symbols:

If escaping is off, the p.r. is simply the successive
characters of the print-name of the symbol. If escaping is on,
two changes must be made.  First, the symbol might require a package prefix
in order that 3read* work correctly, assuming that the package into which
3read* will read the symbol is the one in which it is being printed.
See the chapter on packages ((package)) for an explanation
of the package name prefix.  If the symbol is one which would have
another symbol substituted for it if printed normally and read back,
such as the symbol 3member* printed using Common Lisp syntax
which would be replaced with 3cli:member* if read in thus,
it is printed with a package prefix (e.g., 3global:member*)
to make it read in properly.  See (reader-symbol-substitutions)
for more information on this.

If the symbol is uninterned, 7#:* is printed instead of a package
prefix, provided 3*print-gensym** is non-3nil*.

Secondly, if the p.r. would not read in as a symbol at all (that is, if
the print-name looks like a number, or contains special characters),
then escape characters are added so as to suppress the other reading.
Two kinds of escape characters may be used: single-character escapes
and multiple escapes.  A single-character escape can be used in front of
a character to overrule its special syntactic meaning.  Multiple escapes
are used in pairs, and all the characters between the pair have their
special syntactic meanings suppressed 2except single-character escapes*.
If the symbol name contains escape characters, they are escaped with
single-character escapes.  If the symbol name contains anything else
problematical, a pair of multiple escape characters are printed around it.

The single-character and multiple escape characters are determined by
the current readtable.  Standardly the multiple escape character is
vertical bar (3|*), in both traditional and Common Lisp syntax.  The
single-character escape character is slash (3/*) in traditional syntax
and backslash (3\*) in Common Lisp syntax.

.lisp
FOO        ;1typical symbol, name composed of upper case letters*
A/|B       ;1symbol with a vertical bar in its name*
|Symbol with lower case and spaces in its name|
|One containing slash (//) and vertical bar (/|) also|
.end_lisp

Except when multiple escape characters are printed, any upper case
letters in the symbol's name may be printed as lower case, according to
the value of the variable 3*print-case**.  This is true whether escaping
is enabled or not.  See the next section for
details.

.need 1800
.nopara
Conses:

The p.r. for conses tends to favor 2lists*.  It starts with an
open-parenthesis.  Then the car of the cons is printed and the
cdr of the cons is examined.  If it is 3nil*, a close-parenthesis
is printed.  If it is anything else but a cons, space dot space followed
by that object is printed.  If it is a cons, we print a space and start
all over (from the point 2after* we printed the open-parenthesis)
using this new cons.  Thus, a list is printed as an open-parenthesis,
the p.r.'s of its elements separated by spaces, and a close-parenthesis.
This is how the printer produces representations such as 3(a b (foo bar)
c)* in preference to synonymous forms such as 3(a . (b . ((foo . (bar
. nil)) . (c . nil))))*.

The following additional feature is provided for the p.r. of conses: as
a list is printed, 3print* maintains the length of the list so far and
the depth of recursion of printing lists.  If the length exceeds the
value of the variable 3*print-length**, 3print* terminates the
printed representation of the list with an ellipsis (three periods) and
a close-parenthesis.  If the depth of recursion exceeds the value of the
variable 3*print-level**, then the character 7#* is printed instead
of the list.  These two features allow a kind of abbreviated printing
that is more concise and suppresses detail.  Of course, neither the
ellipsis nor the 7#* can be interpreted by 3read*, since the
relevant information is lost.  In Common Lisp read syntax, either one
causes 3read* to signal an error.

If 3*print-pretty** is non-3nil*, conses are given to the grinder to print.

If 3*print-circle** is non-3nil*, a check is made for cars or cdrs
that are circular or shared structure, and any object (except for an
interned symbol) already mentioned is replaced by a 7#2n*#* label
reference.  See (circular-structure-reading) for more information on them.

.lisp
(let ((*print-circle* t))
  (prin1 (circular-list 3 4)))
.exdent 96 prints
#1= (3 4 . #1#)
.end_lisp

.need 1800
.nopara
Character Objects:

When escaping is off, a character object is printed by printing the
character itself, with no delimiters.

In Common Lisp syntax, a character object is printed with escaping as
7#2font*\2character-or-name**.  2font* is the character's font
number, in decimal, or is omitted if zero.  2character-or-name* begins
with prefixes for any modifier bits (control, meta, etc.) present in
the character, each followed by a hyphen.  Then comes a representation
of the character sans font and modifier bits.  If this reduced character
is a graphic character, it represents itself.  Otherwise, it certainly
has a standard name; the name is used.  If a graphic characters has special
syntactic properties (such as whitespace, paretheses, and macro characters)
and modifier bit prefixes have been printed then
a single-character escape character is printed before it.

In traditional syntax, the p.r. is the similar except that the 7\* is
replaced by 7/*.

.need 1800
.nopara
Strings:

If escaping is off, the p.r. is simply the successive characters of the
string.  If escaping is on, double-quote characters (`3"*') are printed
surrounding the contents, and any single-character escape characters or
double-quotes inside the contents are preceded by single-character
escapes.  If the string contains a Return character followed by an open
parenthesis, a single-character escape is printed before the open
parenthesis.  Examples:
.lisp
"Foo"
"/"Foo/", he said."
.end_lisp

.need 1800
.nopara
Named Structures:

If the named structure type symbol has a 3named-structure-invoke*
property, the property is called as a function with four arguments: the
symbol 3:print-self*, the named structure itself, the stream to print
on, and the current 2depth* of list structure (see below).  It is this
function's responsibility to output a suitable printed representation to
the stream.  This allows a user to define his own p.r. for his named
structures; more information can be found in the named structure section
(see (named-structure)).  Typically the printed representation used
starts with either 7#*3<* if it is not supposed to be readable or 7#*
(see (horseshoe-read)) if it is supposed to be readable.

If the named structure symbol does not have a 3named-structure-invoke*
property, the printed-representation depends on whether escaping is in
use.  If it is, 7#s* syntax is used:
.lisp
#s(2named-structure-symbol*
   2component* 2value*
   2component* 2value*
   ...)
.end_lisp
Named structure component values are checked for circular or shared structure
if 3*print-circle** is non-3nil*.

If escaping is off, the p.r. is like that used for miscellaneous data-types: 7#*3<*,
the named structure symbol, the numerical address of the structure, and 3>*.

.need 1800
.nopara
Other Arrays:

If 3*print-array** is non-3nil*, the array is printed in a way which
shows the elements of the array.  Bit vectors use 7#** syntax, other
vectors use 7#(...)* syntax, and arrays of rank other than one use
7#2n*a(...)* syntax.  The printed representation does not indicate
the array type (that is, what elements it is allowed to contain).  If
the printed representation is read in, a general array (array type
3art-q*) is always created.  See (array-syntax) for more information
on these syntaxes.  Examples:
.lisp
(vector 1 2 5) => #(1 2 5)
(make-array '(2 4) :initial-element t) => #2a((t t t t) (t t t t))
.end_lisp

Vector and array groupings count like list groupings in maintaining the
depth value that is compared with 3*print-level** for cutting off
things that get too deep.  More than 3*print-length** elements in a
given vector or array grouping level are cut off with an ellipsis just
like a list that is so long.

Array elements are checked for circular or shared structure if
3*print-circle** is non-3nil*.

If 3*print-array** is 3nil*, the p.r. starts with 7#*3<*.  Then the
3art-* symbol for the array type is printed.  Next the dimensions of
the array are printed, separated by hyphens.  This is followed by a
space, the machine address of the array, and a 3>*, as in
3#<ART-COMPLEX-FLOAT-3-6 34030451>*.

.need 1800
.nopara
Instances and Entities:

If the object says it can handle the
3:print-self* message, that message is sent with three arguments: the
stream to print to, the current 2depth* of list structure (see below),
and whether escaping is enabled.  The object should print a
suitable p.r. on the stream.  See (flavor) for documentation on
instances.  Most such objects print like ``any other data type'' below,
except with additional information such as a name.  Some objects print
only their name when escaping is not in effect (when
3princ*'ed).  Some objects, including pathnames, use a printed
representation that begins with 7#*, ends with 3*, and contains
sufficient information for the reader to reconstruct an
equivalent object.  See (horseshoe-read).  If the object cannot handle
3:print-self*, it is printed like ``any other data type''.

.need 1800
.nopara
Any Other Data Type:

The printed representation starts with 7#*3<* and ends with 3>*.  This
sort of printed representation cannot be read back in.  The 7#*3<* is
followed by the 3dtp-* symbol for this datatype, a space, and the
octal machine address of the object.  The object's name, if one can be
determined, often appears before the address.  If this style of printed
representation is being used for a named structure or instance, other
interesting information may appear as well.  Finally a greater-than sign
(7>*) is printed in octal.  Examples:
.lisp
#'equal => #<DTP-U-ENTRY EQUAL 410>
(value-cell-location nil) => #<DTP-LOCATIVE 1>
.end_lisp

Including the machine address in the p.r. makes it possible to tell two objects of this
kind apart without explicitly calling 3eq* on them.  This can be very useful during
debugging.  It is important to know that if garbage collection is turned on, objects
will occasionally be moved, and therefore their octal machine addresses will be
changed.  It is best to shut off garbage collection temporarily when depending on
these numbers.

Printed representations that start with `7#*3<*' can never be read
back.
This can be a problem if, for example, you are printing a structure into a
file with the intent of reading it in later.  The following feature allows
you to make sure that what you are printing may indeed be read with the reader.

.defvar si:print-readably
When 3si:print-readably* is bound to 3t*, the printer signals an error
if there is an attempt to print an object that cannot be interpreted by 3read*.
When the printer sends a 3:print-self* or a 3:print* message, it assumes
that this error checking is done for it.  Thus it is possible for these messages
2not* to signal an error, if they see fit.
.end_defvar

.defmac si:printing-random-object (object stream . keywords) &body body
The vast majority of objects that define 3:print-self* messages have much
in common.  This macro is provided for convenience so that users do not
have to write out that repetitious code.  It is also the preferred interface
to 3si:print-readably*.  With no keywords, 3si:printing-random-object*
checks the value of 3si:print-readably* and signals an error if it is not
3nil*.  It then prints a number sign and a less-than sign, evaluates the
forms in 2body*, then prints a space, the octal machine address
of the object and
a greater-than sign.  A typical use of this macro might look like:
.lisp
(si:printing-random-object (ship stream :typep)
  (tyo #\space stream)
  (prin1 (ship-name ship) stream))
.end_lisp
This might print 3#<ship "ralph" 23655126>*.
.end_defmac

The following keywords may be used to modify the behaviour of 3si:printing-random-object*:

.table 3
.kitem :no-pointer
This suppresses printing of the octal address of the object.

.kitem :type
This prints the result of 3(type-of 2object*)* after the less-than sign.
In the example above, this option could have been used instead of
the first two forms in the body.
.end_table

.defcondition sys:print-not-readable (3error*)
This condition is signaled by 3si:print-readably* when the object
cannot be printed readably.

The condition instance supports the operation 3:object*, which
returns the object that was being printed.
.end_defcondition

.setq customizing-the-printer section-page

If you want to control the printed representation of some object,
usually the right way to do it is to make the object an array that is a
named structure (see (named-structure)), or an instance of a flavor
(see (flavor)).  However, occasionally it is desirable to get control
over all printing of objects, in order to change, in some way, how they
are printed.  If you need to do this, the best way to proceed is to
customize the behavior of 3si:print-object* (see
(si:print-object-fun)), which is the main internal function of the
printer.  All of the printing functions, such as 3print* and
3princ*, as well as 3format*, go through this function.  The way to
customize it is by using the ``advice'' facility (see (advise)).

.section Options that Control Printing

Several special variables are defined by the system for the user to set or bind
before calling 3print* or other printing functions.  Their values, as set
up by the user, control how various kinds of objects are printed.

.defvar *print-escape*
Escaping is done if this variable is non-3nil*.  See the previous section
for a description of the many effects of escaping.  Most of the output functions
bind this variable to 3t* or to 3nil*, so you rarely use the variable itself.
.end_defvar

.defvar *print-base*
.defvar1 base
The radix to use for printing integers and ratios.  The value must be either an
integer from 2 to 36 or a symbol with a valid 3si:princ-function*
property, such as 3:roman* or 3:english*.

The default value of 3*print-base** is ten.  In input from files, the
3Base* attribute (see (file-attribute-list)) controls the value of
3*print-base** (and of 3*read-base**).

The synonym 3base* is from Maclisp.
.end_defvar

.defvar *print-radix*
If non-3nil*, integers and ratios are output with a prefix or suffix
indicating the radix used to print them.  For integers and radix ten, a
period is printed as a suffix.  Otherwise, a prefix such as 7#x* or
7#3r* is printed.  The default value of 3*print-radix** is 3nil*.
.end_defvar

.defvar *nopoint
If the value of 3*nopoint* is 3nil*, a trailing decimal point
is printed when a fixnum is printed out in base 10.  This allows
the numbers to be read back in correctly even if 3*read-base**
is not 10 at the time of reading.  The default value of 3*nopoint*
is 3t*.  3*nopoint* has no effect if 3*print-radix** is non-3nil*.

3*nopoint* exists for Maclisp compatibility.  But to get truly
compatible behavior, you must set 3*nopoint* to 3nil*
(and, by default, 3base* and 3ibase* to eight).
.end_defvar

.defvar *print-circle*
If non-3nil*, the printer recognizes circular and shared structure and
prints it using 7#2n*=* labels so that it has a finite printed
representation (which can be read back in).  The default is 3nil*,
since 3t* makes printing slower.  See (circular-structure-reading)
for information on the 7#2n*=* construct.
.end_defvar

.defvar *print-pretty*
If non-3nil*, the printer actually calls 3grind-top-level* so that it prints extra
whitespace for the sake of formatting.  The default is 3nil*.
.end_defvar

.defvar *print-gensym*
If non-3nil*, uninterned symbols are printed with the prefix 7#:* to mark them as such
(but only when 3*print-escape** is non-3nil*).  The prefix causes the
reader to construct a similar uninterned symbol when the expression is read.
If 3nil*, no prefix is used for uninterned symbols.  The default is 3t*.
.end_defvar

.defvar *print-array*
If non-3nil*, non-string arrays are printed using the 7#*3(...)*,
7#** or 7#2n*a*3(...)* syntax so that you can see their contents
(and so that they can be read back in).  If 3nil*, such arrays are
printed using 7#*3<...>* syntax and do not show their contents.  The
default is 3nil*.  The printing of strings is not affected by this
variable.
.end_defvar

.defvar *print-case*
Controls the case used for printing upper-case letters in the names of
symbols.  Its value should be 3:upcase*, 3:downcase* or
3:capitalize*.  These mean, respectively, to print those letters as
upper case, to print them as lower case, or to capitalize each word (see
3string-capitalize*, (string-capitalize-fun)).  Any lower case
letters in the symbol name are printed as lower case and escaped
suitably; this flag does not affect them.  Note that the case used for
printing the upper case letters has no effect on reading the symbols
back in, since they are case-converted by 3read*.  Any upper case
letters that happen to be escaped are always printed in upper case.

.lisp
(dolist (*print-case* '(:upcase :downcase :capitalize))
  (prin1-then-space 'foo)
  (prin1-then-space '|Foo|))
.end_lisp
prints 3FOO |Foo| foo |Foo| Foo |Foo| *.
.end_defvar

.defvar *print-level*
.defvar1 prinlevel
3*print-level** can be set to the maximum number of nested lists that
can be printed before the printer gives up and just prints a 7#*
instead of a list element.  If it is 3nil*, which it is initially, any
number of nested lists can be printed.  Otherwise, the value of
3*print-level** must be a fixnum.  Example:
.lisp
(let ((*print-level* 2))
  (prin1 '(a (b (c (d e))))))
.end_lisp
prints 3(a (b #))*.

The synonym 3prinlevel* is from Maclisp.
.end_defvar

.defvar *print-length*
.defvar1 prinlength
3*print-length** can be set to the maximum number of elements of a
list that can be printed before the printer gives up and prints an
ellipsis (three periods).  If it is 3nil*, which it is initially,
any length list may be printed.  Example:
.lisp
(let ((*print-length* 3))
  (prin1 '((a b c d) #(e f g h) (i j k l) (m n o p))))
.end_lisp
prints 3((a b c ...) #(e f g ...) (i j k ...) ...)*.

The synonym 3prinlength* is from Maclisp.

.section What The Reader Accepts
.setq reader section-page
.cindex reader
	The purpose of the reader is to accept characters, interpret
them as the p.r. of a Lisp object, and create and return such an
object.  The reader cannot accept everything that the printer produces;
for example, the p.r.'s of compiled code objects, closures, stack
groups, etc., cannot be read in.  However, it has many features that are
not seen in the printer at all, such as more flexibility, comments, and
convenient abbreviations for frequently-used unwieldy constructs.

	This section shows what kind of p.r.'s the reader understands,
and explains the readtable, reader macros, and various features
provided by 3read*.

.cindex Common Lisp syntax
.cindex traditional syntax
The syntax specified for Common Lisp is incompatible with the
traditional Zetalisp syntax.  Therefore, the Lisp Machine supports
both traditional and Common Lisp syntax, but 3read* must be told
in advance which one to use.  This is controlled by the choice of
readtable (see (readtable)).  When reading input from a file, the Lisp
system chooses the syntax according to the file's attribute list:
Common Lisp syntax is used if the 3Common Lisp* attribute is present
(see (file-attribute-list)).

The main difference between traditional and Common Lisp syntax is
that traditionally the single-character escape is slash (3/*), whereas
in Common Lisp syntax it is backslash (3\*).  Thus, the division
function which in traditional syntax is written 3//* is written
just 3/* in Common Lisp syntax.  The other differences are obscure
and are mentioned below where they occur.

In general, the reader operates by recognizing tokens in the input
stream.  Tokens can be self-delimiting or can be separated by delimiters such as
whitespace.  A token is the p.r. of an atomic object such as a symbol or
number, or a special character such as a parenthesis.  The reader reads one
or more tokens until the complete p.r. of an object has been seen, then
constructs and returns that object.

.cindex escape characters
.setq escape-characters page
2Escape characters* can be used to suppress the special syntactic
significance of any character, including 3:*, 3Space*, 3(* or
3"*.  There are two kinds of escape character: the 2single-character
escape* (3/* in traditional syntax, 3\* in Common Lisp syntax)
suppresses the significance of the immediately following character;
2multiple escapes* (vertical bar, 3|*) are used in pairs, and
suppress the special significance of all the characters except escapes
between the pair.  Escaping a character causes it to be treated as a
token constituent and causes the token containing it to be read as a
symbol.  For example, 3(12 5 x)* represents a list of three elements,
two of which are integers, but 3(/12 5/ x)* or 3(|15| |5 X|)*
represents a list of two elements, both symbols.  Escaping also prevents
conversion of letters to upper case, so that 3|x|* is
the symbol whose print name contains a lower-case 3x*.

The circle-cross (7*) character an 2octal escape character*
which may be useful for including weird characters in the input.  The
next three characters are read and interpreted as an octal number, and the
character whose code is that number replaces the circle-cross and the digits in the
input stream.  This character is always treated as a token constituent and
forces the token to be read as a symbol.  7* is allowed in both traditional
and Common Lisp syntax, but it is not valid Common Lisp.

Integers:

	The reader understands the p.r.'s of integers in a way
more general than is employed by the printer.  Here is a complete
description of the format for integers.

	Let a 2simple integer* be a string of digits, optionally
preceded by a plus sign or a minus sign, and optionally followed by a
trailing decimal point.  A simple integer is interpreted by
3read* as an integer.  If the trailing decimal point is present, the
digits are interpreted in decimal radix; otherwise, they are
considered as a number whose radix is the value of the variable
3*read-base**.

.defvar *read-base*
.defvar1 ibase
The value of 3ibase* or 3*read-base** is an integer between 2 and 36
that is the radix in which integers and ratios are read.  The initial value of is
ten.  For input from files or editor buffers, the 3Base* attribute
specifies the value to be used (see (file-attribute-list)); if it is
not given, the ambient value is used.

The synonym 3ibase* is from Maclisp.
.end_defvar

If the input radix is greater than ten, letters starting with 3a* are
used as additional ``digits'' with values ten and above.  For example, in
radix 16, the letters 3a* through 3f* are digits with values ten
through 15.  Alphabetic case is not significant.  These additional
digits can be used wherever a simple integer is expected and are parsed
using the current input radix.  For example, if 3*read-base** is 16
then 7ff* is recognized as an integer (255 decimal).  So is 310e5*,
which is a float when 3*read-base** is ten.

Traditional syntax also permits a simple integer,
followed by an underscore (3_*) or a circumflex (3^*),
followed by another simple integer.  The two simple integers
are interpreted in the usual way;
the character in between indicates an operation that is then
performed on the two integers.  The underscore indicates a binary
``left shift''; that is, the integer to its left is doubled the
number of times indicated by the integer to its right.  The circumflex
multiplies the integer to its left by 3*read-base** the number of
times indicated by the integer to its right.  (The second simple
integer is not allowed to have a leading minus sign.)  Examples:  33_2*
means 312* and 3645^3* means 3645000*.

Here are some examples of valid representations
of integers to be given to 3read*:

Floating Point Numbers:

.setq flonum-examples page
Floats can be written with or without exponent.
The syntax for a float without exponent is an optional plus or minus sign, optionally
some digits, a decimal point, and one or more digits.  A float with exponent
consists of a simple integer or a float without exponent, followed by an exponent
delimiter (a letter) and a simple integer (the exponent itself) which is the
power of ten by which the number is to be scaled.  The exponent may not have
a trailing decimal point.  Both the mantissa and the exponent are always
interpreted in base ten, regardless of the value of 3*read-base**.

Only certain letters are allowed for delimiting the exponent: 3e*, 3s*, 3f*,
3d* and 3l*.  The case of the letter is not significant.  3s* specifies
that the number should be a short float; 3f*, that it should be a full-size
float.  3d* or 3l* are equivalent to 3f*; Common Lisp defines them
to mean `double float' or `long float', but the Lisp Machine does not support
anything longer than a full-size float, so it regards 3d* and 3l* as synonymous
with 3f*.  3e* tells the reader to use the current default format,
whatever it may be, as specified by the value of 3*read-default-float-format**.

.defvar *read-default-float-format*
The value is the type for read to produce by default for floats whose
precise type is not specified by the syntax.  The value should be either
3global:small-float* or 3global:single-float*, these being the only
distinct floating formats that the Lisp Machine has.  The default is
3single-float*, to make full-size floats.
.end_defvar

Here are some examples of printed-representations that always read as full-size floats:
.lisp
6.03f23  1F-9     1.f3      3d6
.end_lisp

Here are some examples of printed-representations that always read as short floats:
.lisp
0s0      1.5s9    -42S3     1.s5
.end_lisp

These read as floats or as a short floats according to 3*read-default-float-format**:

.end_lisp

.need 1800
.nopara
Rationals:

The syntax for a rational is an integer, a ratio delimiter, and another integer.
The integers may not include the 3^* and 3_* scaling characters
or decimal points, and only the first one may have a sign.
The ratio delimiter is backslash (3\*) in traditional syntax, slash (3/*) in
Common Lisp syntax.  Here are examples:
.lisp
1\2      -100000000000000\3     80\10    1traditional*
1/2      -100000000000000/3     80/10    1Common Lisp*
.end_lisp
Recall that rationals include the integers; 380\10* as input to the
reader is equivalent to 38*.

.need 1800
.nopara
Complex Numbers:

The traditional syntax for a complex number is a number (for the real
part), a sign (+ or 7-*), an unsigned number (for the imaginary part),
and the letter 3i*.  The real and imaginary parts can be any type of
number, but they are converted to be of the same type (both floating of
the same format, or both rational).  For example:
.lisp
1-3\4i
1.2s0+3.45s8i
.end_lisp

The Common Lisp syntax for a complex number is 7#c(2real* 2imag*)*,
where 2real* is the real part and 2imag* is the imaginary part.
This construction is allowed in traditional syntax too.
.lisp
#c(1 -3/4)
#c(1.2s0 3.45s8)
.end_lisp

.need 1800
.nopara
Symbols:

	A string of letters, numbers, and characters without
special syntactic meaning is recognized by the reader as a symbol, provided
it cannot be interpreted as a number.  Alphabetic case is ignored
in symbols; lower-case letters are translated to upper-case unless
escaped.
When the reader sees the p.r. of a symbol, it 2interns* it on a 2package*
(see (package), for an explanation of interning and the package system).
Symbols may start with digits; you could even
have one named 3-345t*; 3read* accepts this as a symbol
without complaint.  If you want to put strange characters (such as
lower-case letters, parentheses, or reader macro characters) inside the name of a symbol,
they must be escaped.  If the symbol's name would look like a number,
at least one character in the name must be escaped, but it matters not which one.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Examples of symbols:
foo
bar/(baz/)    1; traditional*
bar\(baz\)    1; Common Lisp*
34w23
|Frob Sale| 1and* F|rob |S|ale| 1are equivalent*

|a/|b|    1; traditional*
|a\|b|    1; Common Lisp*
.end_lisp

In Common Lisp syntax, a symbol composed only of two or more periods is not allowed
unless escaping is used.
.setq reader-symbol-substitutions page

The reader can be directed to perform substitutions on the symbols it
reads.  Symbol substitutions are used to implement the incompatible
Common Lisp definitions of various system functions.  Reading of Common
Lisp code is done with substitutions that replace 3subst* with
3cli:subst*, 3member* with 3cli:member*, and so on.  This is why,
when a Common Lisp program uses the function 3member*, it gets the
standard Common Lisp 3member* function rather than the traditional
one.  This is why we say that 3cli:member* is ``the Common Lisp
version of 3member*''.  While 3cli:member* can be referred to from
any program in just that way, it exists primarily to be referred to from
a Common Lisp program which says simply 3member*.

Symbol substitutions do not apply to symbols written with package
prefixes, so one can use a package prefix to force a reference to a
symbol that is normally substituted for, such as using 3global:member*
in a Common Lisp program.

.need 1800

Strings:

Strings are written with double-quote characters (3"*) before and after
the string contents.  To include a double-quote character or single-character escape
character in the contents, write an extra single-character escape character
in front of it.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Examples of strings:
"This is a typical string."
"That is a /"cons cell/"."    1;; traditional*
"That is a \"cons cell\"."    1;; Common Lisp*
"Strings are often used for I//O."    1;; traditional*
"Strings are often used for I/O."     1;; Common Lisp*
"Here comes one backslash: \\"        1;; Common Lisp*
.end_lisp

.need 1800
.nopara
Conses:

	When 3read* sees an open-parenthesis, it knows that
the p.r. of a cons is coming, and calls itself recursively to
get the elements of the cons or the list that follows.
The following are valid p.r.'s of conses:
.lisp
(foo . bar)
(foo "bar" 33)
(foo . ("bar" . (33 . nil)))
(foo bar . quux)
.end_lisp
The first is a cons, whose car and cdr are both symbols.  The second
is a list, and the third is equivalent to the second (although
3print* would never produce it).  The fourth is a dotted list;
the cdr of the last cons cell (the second one) is not 3nil*, but
3quux*.
'cindex dotted list

The reader always allocates new cons cells to represent parentheses.
They are never shared with other structure, not even part of the same read.
For example,
.lisp
(let ((x (read)))
  (eq (car x) (cdr x)))
((a b) . (a b))          1;; data for 3read**
  => nil
.end_lisp
because each time 3(a b)* is read, a new list is constructed.  This contrasts
with the case for symbols, as very often 3read* returns symbols
that it found interned in the package rather than creating new symbols
itself.  Symbols are the only thing that work this way.

	The dot that separates the two elements of a dotted-pair p.r.
for a cons is only recognized if it is surrounded by delimiters
(typically spaces).  Thus dot may be freely used within print-names of
symbols and within numbers.  This is not compatible with Maclisp; in
Maclisp 3(a.b)* reads as a cons of symbols 3a* and 3b*, whereas in
Zetalisp it reads as a list of a symbol 3a.b*.

.need 1800
.nopara
Comments:

A comment begins with a semicolon (3;*) and continues to the end of
the line.  Comments are ignored completely by the reader.  If the
semicolon is escaped or inside a string, it is not recognized as
starting a comment; it is part of a symbol or part of the string.
.lisp
;; This is a comment.
"This is a string; but no comment."
.end_lisp

Another way to write a comment is to start it with 7#|* and end it with 7|#*.
This is useful for commenting out multiple-line segments of code.
The two delimiters nest, so that 7#| #| |# |#* is a single comment.
This prevents surprising results if you use this construct to comment out
code which already contains such a comment.

.lisp
(cond ((atom x) y)
 #|
      ((foo x)
       (do-it y))
    |#
      (t (hack y)))
.end_lisp

.need 1800
.nopara
Abbreviations:

The single-quote character (3'*) is an abbreviation for a list starting with the
symbol 3quote*.  The following pairs of p.r.'s produce equal lists:
.lisp
'a   1and*   (quote a)
'(x (y))   1and*   (quote (x (y)))
.end_lisp

The backquote character (3`*) and comma are used in a syntax that
abbreviates calls to the list and vector construction functions.
For example,
.lisp
`(a ,b c)
.end_lisp
reads as a list whose meaning as a Lisp form is equivalent to
.lisp
(list 'a b 'c)
.end_lisp
See (backquote) for full details about backquote.

.subsection Sharp-sign Constructs
.cindex sharp sign reader macros
.cindex # reader macros

Sharp-sign (3#*) is used to introduce syntax extensions.
It is the beginning of a two-character sequence whose meaning
depends on the second character.  Sharp-sign is only recognized with
a special meaning if it occurs at the beginning of a token.
If encountered while a token is in progress, it is a symbol constituent.
For example, 7#xff* is a sharp-sign construct that interprets
7ff* as a hexidecimal number, but 71#xff* is just a symbol.

If the sharp-sign is followed by decimal digits, the digits form a
parameter.  The first non-digit determines which sharp-sign construct
is actually in use, and the decimal integer parsed from the digits
is passed to it.  For example, 7#r* means ``read in specified radix'';
it must actually be used with a radix notated in decimal between the 7#*
and the 7r*, as in 7#8r*.

It is possible for a sharp-sign construct to have different meanings
in Common Lisp and traditional syntax.  The only constructs which
differ are 7#\* and 7#/*.

The function 3set-dispatch-macro-character* (see
(set-dispatch-macro-character-fun)) can be used to define additional
sharp sign abbreviations.

Here are the currently-defined sharp sign constructs:

.table 3 0 500
.setq sharp-slash page
.item #/
7#/* is used in traditional syntax only to represent the number that
is the character code for a character.  You can follow the 7#/* with
the character itself, or with the character's name.  The name is
preferable for nonprinting characters, and it is the only way to
represent characters which have control bits since they cannot go in
files.  Here are examples of 7#/*:
.lisp
#/a          #o141
#/A          #o101
#/(          #o50
#/c-a        1the character code for 3Control-A**
#/c-/a       1the character code for 3Control-a**
#/c-sh-a     1the character code for 3Control-a**
#/c-/A       1the character code for 3Control-A**
#/c-/(       1the character code for 3Control-(**
#/return     1the character code for 3Return**
#/h-m-system 1the character code for 3Hyper-Meta-System**
.end_lisp

To represent a printing character, write 7#/2x** where 2x* is the
character.  For example, 7#/a* is equivalent to 3#o141* but clearer
in its intent.  To avoid ambiguity, the character following 2x* should
not be a letter; good style would require this anyway.

As in strings, upper and lower-case letters are distinguished after
7#/*.  Any character works after 7#/*, even those that are normally
special to 3read*, such as parentheses.  Thus, 7#/A* is equivalent
to 3#o101*, and 7#/(* is equivalent to 3#o50*.  Note that the
slash causes this construct to be parsed correctly by the editors Emacs
and Zmacs.  Even non-printing characters may be used, but for them it is
preferable to use the character's name.

To refer to a character by name, write 7#/* followed by the name.  For
example, 7#/*3return* reads as the numeric code for the character
3Return*.  The defined character names are documented below (see
(xr-special-character-names)).  In general, the names that are written
on the keyboard keys are accepted.  In addition, all the nonalphanumeric
characters have names.  The abbreviations 3cr* for 3return* and
3sp* for 3space* are accepted, since these characters are used so
frequently.  The page separator character is called 3page*, although
3form* and 3clear-screen* are also accepted since the keyboard has
one of those legends on the page key.  The rules for reading 2name*
are the same as those for symbols; thus letters are converted to upper
case unless escaped, and the name must be terminated by a delimiter such
as a space, a carriage return, or a parenthesis.

When the system types out the name of a special character, it uses the same table
that 7#/* uses; therefore, any character name typed out is acceptable as input.

7#/* can also be used to read in the names of characters that have
modifier bits (Control, Meta, Super and Hyper).  The syntax looks like
7#/*3control-meta-b* to get a `B' character with the control and
meta bits set.  You can use any of the prefix bit names 3control*,
3meta*, 3hyper*, and 3super*.  They may be in any order, and case
is not significant.  Prefix bit names can be abbreviated as the single
letters 3c*, 3m*, 3h* and 3s*, and 3control* may be spelled
3ctrl* as it is on the keyboard.  The last hyphen may be followed by a
single character or by any of the special character names normally
recognized by 7#/*.  A single character is treated the same way the
reader normally treats characters in symbols; if you want to use a
lower-case character or a special character such as a parenthesis, you
must precede it by a slash character.  Examples:
7#/*3Hyper-Super-A*, 7#/*3meta-hyper-roman-i*,
7#/*3CTRL-META-/(*.

An obsolete method of specifying control bits in a character is to
insert the characters 3*, 3*, 3*, 3* and 3* between the
7#* and the 7/*.  Those stand for 3control*, 3meta*,
3control-meta*, 3super* and 3hyper*, respectively.  This syntax should
be converted to the new 7#\*3control-meta-x* syntax described below.

3greek* (or 3front*), 3top*, and 3shift* (or 3sh*) are also
allowed as prefixes of names.  Thus, 7#/*3top-g* is equivalent to
7#/* or 7#/*3uparrow*.  7#/*3top-g* should be used if you are
specifying the keyboard commands of a program and the mnemonic
significance belongs to the `3G*' rather than to the actual character
code.

.item #\
In traditional syntax, 7#\* is a synonym for 7#/*.
In the past, 7#/* had to be used before a single character
and 7#\* had to be used in all other cases.  Now either one is allowed
in either case.

In Common Lisp syntax, 7#\* produces a character object rather than
a fixnum representing a character.

.item #/
7#/*2x* is the traditional syntax way to produce a character object.
It is used just like 7#/*.  Thus, Common Lisp 7#\* is equivalent to
traditional syntax 7#/*.

.item #^
7#^2x** is exactly like 7#/*3control-2x** if the input is being
read by Zetalisp; it generates Control-2x*.
In Maclisp 2x* is converted to upper case and then exclusive-or'ed with 100 (octal).
Thus 7#^2x** always generates the character returned by 3tyi* if
the user holds down the control key and types 2x*.
(In Maclisp 7#/*3control-2x** sets the bit set by the Control key when the TTY is
open in 3fixnum* mode.)

.item #'
7#'2foo** is an abbreviation for 3(function 2foo*)*.
2foo* is the p.r. of any object.  This abbreviation can be remembered by
analogy with the 3'* macro-character, since the 3function* and 3quote*
special forms are somewhat analogous.

.item #(
7#(2elements*...)* constructs a vector (rank-one array) of type
3art-q* with elements 2elements*.  The length of the vector is the
number of elements written.  Thus, 7#*3(a 5 "Foo")* reads as a vector
containing a symbol, an integer and a string.  If a decimal integer
appears after the 7#*, it specifies the length of the vector.
The last element written is replicated to fill the remaining elements.

.setq array-syntax page
.item #a
7#2n*a 2contents** signifies an array of rank 2n*, containing 2contents*.
2contents* is passed to 3make-array* as the 2initial-contents*
argument.  It is a list of lists of lists... or vector of vectors...
as deep as 2n*.  The dimensions of the array are specified by the
lengths of the lists or vectors.  The rank is specified
explicitly so that the reader can distinguish whether a list or vector
in the contents is a sequence of array elements or a single array element.
The array type is always 3art-q*.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Examples:
#2a ((x y) (a b) ((uu 3) "VV"))
.exdent 96 produces a 3 by 2 array.  3(uu 3)* is one of the elements.
#2a ("foo" "bar")
.end_lisp
produces a 2 by 3 array whose elements are character objects.
Recall that a string is a kind of vector.
.lisp
#0a 5
.end_lisp
produces a rank-0 array whose sole element is 5.

.item #*
7#*2bbb*...* signifies a bit vector; 2bbb*... are the bits
(characters 31* or 30*).  A vector of type 3art-1b* is created
and filled with the specified bits, the first bit specified going in
array element 0.  The length is however many bits you specify.
Alternatively, specify the length with a decimal number between the
7#* and the 7**.  The last 31* or 30* specified is duplicated
to fill the additional bits.  Thus, 7#8*3*0101* is the same as 7#**301011111*.

.item #s
7#s(2type* 2slot* 2value* 2slot* 2value* 2slot* 2value* ...)*
constructs a structure of type 2type*.  Any structure type defined with
3defstruct* can be used as 2type* provided it has a standard constructor
taking slot values as keyword arguments.  (Standard constructors can be
functions or macros; either kind works for 7#s*.)  The slot names
and values appearing in the read syntax are passed to the constructor
so that they initialize the structure.  Example:
.lisp
(defstruct (foo :named)
  bar
  lose)
#s (foo :bar 5 :lose haha)
.end_lisp
produces a 3foo* whose 3bar* component is 5 and whose 3lose* component
is 3haha*.

.item #=
.item1 ##
'setq circular-structure-reading page
Are used to represent circular structure or shared structure.
7#2n*=* preceding an object ``labels'' that object with the label 2n*,
a decimal integer.  This has no effect on the way the object labeled
is read, but it makes the label available for use in a 7#2n*#* construct
within that object (to create circular structure) or later on (to create
shared structure).  7#2n*#* counts as an object in itself, and reads
as the object labeled by 2n*.  

For example, 7#1=*3(a . 7#1#*)* is a way of notating a circular list such
as would be produced by 3(circular-list 'a)*.  The list is labeled
with label 1, and then its cdr is given as a reference to label 1.
3(7#1=#:*foo 7#1#*)* is an example of shared structure.  An uninterned
symbol named 3foo* is used as the first element of the list, and
labeled.  The second element of the list is the very same uninterned
symbol, by virtue of a reference to the label.

Printing outputs 7#2n*=* and 7#2n*#* to represent circular or
shared structure when 3*print-circle* is non-3nil*.

.item #,
Evaluate a form at load time.
7#,2foo** evaluates 2foo* (the p.r. of a Lisp form) at read
time, except that during file-to-file compilation it is arranged
that 2foo* will be evaluated when the QFASL file is loaded.  This is a way,
for example, to include in your code complex list-structure constants that cannot
be written with 3quote*.  Note that the reader does not put 3quote*
around the result of the evaluation.  You must do this yourself if you
want it, typically by using the 3'* macro-character.  An example of 
a case where you do not want 3quote* around it is when this object is
an element of a constant list.

.item #.
7#.2foo** evaluates 2foo* (the p.r. of a lisp form) at read
time, regardless of who is doing the reading.

.item #`
7#`* is a construct for repeating an expression with some
subexpressions varying.  It is an abbreviation for writing several
similar expressions or for the use of 3mapc*.  Each subexpression
that is to be varied is written as a comma followed by a list of the
things to substitute.  The expression is expanded at read time into
a 3progn* containing the individual versions.
.lisp
#`(send stream ',(:clear-input :clear-output))
.end_lisp
expands into
.lisp
(progn (send stream :clear-input)
       (send stream :clear-output))
.end_lisp

Multiple repetitions can be done in parallel by using commas
in several subexpressions:
.lisp
#`(rename-file ,("foo" "bar") ,("ofoo" "obar"))
.end_lisp
expands into
.lisp
(progn (rename-file "foo" "ofoo")
       (rename-file "bar" "obar"))
.end_lisp

If you want to do multiple independent repetitions, you must use nested
7#`* constructs.  Individual commas inside the inner 7#`* apply to
that 7#`*; they vary at maximum speed.  To specify a subexpression
that varies in the outer 7#`*, use two commas.
.lisp
#`#`(print (* ,(5 7) ,,(11. 13.)))
.end_lisp
expands into
.lisp
(progn (progn (print (* 5 11.)) (print (* 7 11.)))
       (progn (print (* 5 13.)) (print (* 7 13.)))
.end_lisp

.item #o
7#o 2number** reads 2number* in octal regardless of the
setting of 3*read-base**.  Actually, any expression can be prefixed
by 7#o*; it is read with 3*read-base** bound to 8.

.item #b
Like 7#o* but reads in binary.

.item #x
Like 7#x* but reads in radix 16 (hexadecimal).  The letters 3a*
through 3f* are used as the digits beyond 9.

.item #r
7#2radix*r 2number** reads 2number* in radix 2radix* regardless
of the setting of 3*read-base**.  As with 7#o*, any expression
can be prefixed by 7#2radix*r*; it is read with 3*read-base**
bound to 2radix*.  2radix* must be a valid decimal integer between
2 and 36.

For example, 7#3r102* is another way of writing 311.* and
7#11r32* is another way of writing 335*.  Bases larger than ten use
the letters starting with 3a* as the additional digits.

.item #c
7#c(2real* 2imag*)* constructs a complex number with real part
2real* and imaginary 2part*.  It is equivalent to 32real*+2imag*i*,
except that 7#c* is allowed in Common Lisp syntax and the other is not.

.cindex conditionalization, read-time
.item #+
'setq sharp-plus page
This abbreviation provides a read-time conditionalization facility.  It
is used as 7#+2feature* 2form**.  If 2feature* is a symbol, then
this is read as 2form* if 2feature* is present in the list
3*features** (see (*features*-var)).  Otherwise, the construct is
regarded as whitespace.

Alternately, 2feature* may be a boolean expression composed of 3and*, 3or*, and
3not* operators and symbols representing items that may appear on
3*features**.  Thus,
7#+*3(or lispm amber)* causes the following object to be seen
if either of the features 3lispm* or 3amber* is present.

For example, 7#+*3lispm 2form** makes 2form* count if being read by Zetalisp,
and is thus equivalent to 7#q 2form**.  Similarly, 7#+*3maclisp 2form** is equivalent
to 7#m 2form**.  7#+*3(or lispm nil) 2form** makes 2form* count on either
Zetalisp or in NIL.

Here is a list of features with standard meanings:
.table 3
.item lispm
This feature is present on any Lisp machine (no matter what version of hardware
or software).

.item maclisp
This feature is present in Maclisp.

.item nil
This feature is present in NIL (New Implementation of Lisp).

.item mit
This feature is present in the MIT Lisp machine system,
which is what this manual is about.

.item symbolics
This feature is present in the Symbolics version of the Lisp machine system.
May you be spared the dishonor of using it.
.end_table

7#+*, and the other read-time conditionalization constructs that
follow, discard the following expression by reading it with
3*read-suppress** bound to 3t* if the specified condition is false.

.item #-
7#-2feature* 2form** is equivalent to 7#+*3(not 2feature*) 2form**.

.item #q
7#q 2foo** reads as 2foo* if the input is being read by
Zetalisp, otherwise it reads as nothing (whitespace).
This is considered obsolete; use 7#+*3lispm* instead.

.item #m
7#m 2foo** reads as 2foo* if the input is being read into Maclisp,
otherwise it reads as nothing (whitespace).
This is considered obsolete; use 7#+*3maclisp* instead.

.item #n
7#n 2foo** reads as 2foo* if the input is being read into NIL
or compiled to run in NIL, otherwise it reads as nothing (white space).
This is considered obsolete; use 7#+*3nil* instead.

.item #
7#*3* introduces an expression in infix notation.  3* should be used
to terminate it.  The text in between describes a Lisp object such as a symbol,
number or list but using a nonstandard, infix-oriented syntax.  For example,
.lisp
#x:y+car(a1[i,j])
.exdent 96 is equivalent to
(setq x (+ y (car (aref a1 i j))))
.end_lisp

It is not strictly true that the Lisp object produced in this way has to be
an expression.  Since the conversion is done at read time, you can use
a list expressed this way for any purpose.  But the infix syntax is designed
to be used for expressions.

For full details, refer to the file 3SYS: IO1; INFIX LISP*.

.item #<
This is not legal reader syntax.  It is used in the p.r. of objects that cannot
be read back in.  Attempting to read a 7#*3<* signals an error.

.item #
.setq horseshoe-read page
This is used in the p.r. of miscellaneous objects (usually named
structures or instances) that can be read back in.  7#*3* should be
followed by a typename and any other data needed to construct an
object, terminated with a 3*.  For example, a pathname might print as
.lisp
#FS:ITS-PATHNAME "AI: RMS; TEST 5"
.end_lisp
The typename is a keyword that 3read* uses to figure out how to read in
the rest of the printed representation and construct the object.  It is read in in
package 3user* (but it can contain a package prefix).  The resulting symbol
should either have a 3si:read-instance* property or be the name of a flavor
that handles the 3:read-instance* operation.

In the first case, the property is applied as a function to the typename
symbol itself and the input stream.  In the second, the handler for that
operation is applied to the operation name (as always), the typename
symbol, and the input stream (three arguments, but the first is implicit
and not mentioned in the 3defmethod*).  3self* will be 3nil* and
instance variables should not be referred to.
3si:print-readably-mixin* is a useful implementation the
3:read-instance* operation for general purposes; see
(si:print-readably-mixin-flavor).

In either case, the handler function should read the remaining data from
the stream, and construct and return the datum it describes.  It should
return with the 3* character waiting to be read from the input stream
(3:untyi* it if necessary).  3read* signals an error after it is returned
to if a 3* character is not next.

The typename can be any symbol with an appropriate property or flavor, not
necessarily related to the type of object that is created; but for clarity, it is good
if it is the same as the 3type-of* of the object printed.  Since the type symbol is
passed to the handler, one flavor's handler can be inherited by many other
flavors and can examine the type symbol read in to decide what flavor to
construct.

.item #|
7#|* is used to comment out entire pieces of code.  Such a comment
begins with 7#|* and ends with 7|#*.  The text in between should be
one or more properly balanced p.r.'s of Lisp objects, possibly
including nested 7#|...|#* comments.  This text is skipped over by the
reader, and does not contribute to the value returned by 3read*.
.end_table

.section Expression Output Functions
.setq expression-output section-page
.cindex printing
.cindex expression output

These functions all take an optional argument called 2stream*, which is
where to send the output.  If unsupplied 2stream* defaults to the value of
3*standard-output**.  If 2stream* is 3nil*, the value of
3*standard-output** (i.e. the default) is used.  If it is 3t*, the value of
3*terminal-io** is used (i.e. the interactive terminal).  This is all
more-or-less compatible with Maclisp, except that instead of the
variable 3*standard-output** Maclisp has several variables and complicated rules.
For detailed documentation of streams, refer to (streams).

.defun prin1 object &optional stream
Outputs the printed representation of 2object* to
2stream*, with escaping (see (escaping)).
2object* is returned.
.end_defun

.defun prin1-then-space object &optional stream
Like 3prin1* except that output
is followed by a space.
.end_defun

.defun print object &optional stream
Like 3prin1* except that output
is preceded by a carriage return and followed by a space.
2object* is returned.
.end_defun

.defun princ object &optional stream
Like 3prin1* except that the output is not escaped.  2object* is
returned.
.end_defun

.defun write object &key stream escape radix base circle pretty level length case gensym array
Prints 2object* on 2stream*, having bound all the printing flags according to the
keyword arguments if specified.  For example, the keyword argument 2array* specifies how
to bind 3*print-array**; if 2array* is omitted, the ambient value of 3*print-array**
is used.  This function is sometimes cleaner than binding a printing control variable
explicitly.  The value is 2object*.
.end_defun

.subsection Pretty-Printing Output Functions
.cindex formatting lisp code
.cindex pretty-printing
.cindex grinding

.c If we ever get a new grinder, this section will document how to
.c customize it and that sort of thing.

.defun pprint object &optional stream
3pprint* is like 3prin1* except that 3*print-pretty** is bound to 3t*
so that the grinder is used.  3pprint* returns zero values, just as
the form 3(values)* does.
.end_defun

.defmac grindef function-spec...
'setq grind page
Prints the definitions of one or more functions, with indentation to make the code
readable.  Certain other ``pretty-printing'' transformations are performed:  The 3quote*
special form is represented with the 3'* character.  Displacing macros are
printed as the original code rather than the result of macro expansion.
The code resulting from the backquote (3`*) reader macro is represented
in terms of 3`*.

The subforms to 3grindef* are the function specs whose
definitions are to be printed; the usual way 3grindef* is used
is with a form like 3(grindef foo)* to print the definition
of 3foo*.  When one of these subforms is a symbol, if
the symbol has a value its value is prettily printed also.  Definitions are
printed as 3defun* special forms, and values are printed as 3setq* special
forms.

If a function is compiled, 3grindef* says so and tries to find its
previous interpreted definition by looking on an associated property
list (see 3uncompile* ((uncompile-fun)).  This works only if the
function's interpreted definition was once in force; if the definition
of the function was simply loaded from a QFASL file, 3grindef* cannot
not find the interpreted definition.

With no subforms, 3grindef* assumes the same arguments as when it was
last called.
.end_defmac

.defun grind-top-level obj &optional width (stream 3*standard-output**) (untyo-p 3nil*) (displaced 3'si:displaced*) (terpri-p 3t*) notify-fun loc
Pretty-prints 2obj* on 2stream*, putting up to 2width* characters
per line.  This is the primitive interface to the pretty-printer.  Note that it does not
support variable-width fonts.  If the 2width* argument is supplied, it is how many
characters wide the output is to be.  If 2width* is unsupplied or 3nil*,
3grind-top-level* tries to figure out the natural width of the stream,
by sending a 3:size-in-characters* message to the stream and using the first
returned value.  If the stream doesn't handle that message, a width of 395.*
characters is used instead.

The remaining optional arguments activate various strange features and usually should not
be supplied.  These options are for internal use by the system and are documented
here for only completeness.
If 2untyo-p* is 3t*, the 3:untyo* and 3:untyo-mark* operations are
be used on 2stream*, speeding up the algorithm somewhat.  2displaced* controls the
checking for displacing macros; it is the symbol which flags a place that has been
displaced, or 3nil* to disable the feature.
If 2terpri-p* is 3nil*, 3grind-top-level* does
not advance to a fresh line before printing.

If 2notify-fun* is non-3nil*, it should be a function that to be
called with three arguments for each ``token'' in the pretty-printed
output.  Tokens are atoms, open and close parentheses, and reader macro
characters such as 7'*.  The arguments given to 2notify-fun* are the
token, its ``location'' (see next paragraph), and 3t* if it is an atom
or 3nil* if it is a character.

2loc* is the ``location'' (typically a cons) whose car is 2obj*.  As the
grinder recursively descends through the structure being printed, it keeps track
of the location where each thing came from, for the benefit of the 2notify-fun*.
This makes it possible for a program to correlate the printed output
with the list structure.  The ``location'' of a close parenthesis is 3t*, because
close parentheses have no associated location.
.end_defun

.subsection Non-Stream Printing Functions

.defun write-to-string object &key escape radix base circle pretty level length case gensym array
.defun1 prin1-to-string object
.defun1 princ-to-string object
Like 3write*, 3prin1* and 3princ*, respectively, but put the output in a string
and return the string (see (write-fun)).
.end_defun

See also the 3with-output-to-string* special form ((with-output-to-string-fun)).

The following obsolete functions are for Maclisp compatibility only.
The examples use traditional syntax.

.defun exploden object
Returns a list of characters (represented as fixnums) that
are the characters that would be typed out by 3(princ 2object*)*
(i.e. the unescaped printed representation of 2object*).
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(exploden '(+ /12 3)) => #o(50 53 40 61 62 40 63 51)
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun explodec object
Returns a list of characters represented by symbols,
interned in the current package,
whose names are the characters that would be typed out by 
3(princ 2object*)* (i.e. the unescaped printed representation of 2object*).
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(explodec '(+ /12 3)) => (|(| + | | |1| |2| | | |3| |)|)
.end_lisp
(Note that there are escaped spaces in the above list.)
.end_defun

.defun explode object
Like 3explodec* but uses the escaped printed representation.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(explode '(+ /12 3)) => (|(| + | | // |1| |2| | | |3| |)|)
.end_lisp
(Note that there are escaped spaces in the above list.)
.end_defun

.defun flatsize object
Returns the number of characters in the escaped printed representation
of 2object*.
.end_defun

.defun flatc object
Returns the number of characters in the unescaped printed representation
of 2object*.
.end_defun

.section Expression Input Functions
.setq expression-input section-page
.cindex reading
.cindex expression input

Most expression input functions read characters from an input stream.
This argument is called 2stream*.  If unsupplied it
defaults to the value of 3*standard-input**.

All of these functions echo their input and permit editing if used on an
interactive stream (one which supports the 3:rubout-handler*
operation; see below.)

The functions accept an argument 2eof-option* or two arguments
2eof-error* and 2eof-value* to tell them what to do if end of file
is encountered instead of an object's p.r.  The functions that take
two 2eof-* arguments are the Common Lisp ones.

In functions that accept the 2eof-option* argument, if no argument
is supplied, an error is signaled at eof.  If the argument is
supplied, end of file causes the function to return that argument.  Note
that an 2eof-option* of 3nil* means to return 3nil* if the end of
the file is reached; it is 2not* equivalent to supplying no
2eof-option*.

In functions that accept two arguments 2eof-error* and 2eof-value*,
end of file is an error if 2eof-error* is non-3nil* or if it is unsupplied.
If 2eof-error* is 3nil*, then the function returns 2eof-value*
at end of file.

An error is always signaled if end of file is encountered in the middle
of an object; for example, if a file does not contain enough right
parentheses to balance the left parentheses in it.  Mere whitespace does
not count as starting an object.  If a file contains a symbol or a number
immediately followed by end-of-file, it can be read normally without
error; if an attempt is made to read further, end of file is encountered
immediately and the 2eof-* argument(s) obeyed. 

These end-of-file conventions are not completely compatible with
Maclisp.  Maclisp's deviations from this are generally considered to be
bugs rather than features.

For Maclisp compatibility, 3nil* as the 2stream* argument also means
to use the value of 3*standard-input**, and 3t* as the 2stream*
argument means to use the value of 3*terminal-io**.  This is only
advertised to work in functions that Maclisp has, and should not be
written in new programs.  Instead of the variable 3*standard-input**
Maclisp has several variables and complicated rules.  For detailed
documentation of streams, refer to (streams).

The functions below that take 2stream* and 2eof-option* arguments
can also be called with the stream and eof-option in the other order.
This functionality is only for compatibility with old Maclisp programs,
and should never be used in new programs.  The functions attempt to
figure out which way they were called by seeing whether each argument is
a plausible stream.  Unfortunately, there is an ambiguity with symbols:
a symbol might be a stream and it might be an eof-option.  If there are
two arguments, one being a symbol and the other being something that is
a valid stream, or only one argument, which is a symbol, then these
functions interpret the symbol as an eof-option instead of as a
stream.  To force them to interpret a symbol as a stream, give the
symbol an 3si:io-stream-p* property whose value is 3t*.

.defun read &optional stream eof-option rubout-handler-options
Reads the printed representation of a Lisp object
from 2stream*, builds a corresponding Lisp object, and returns
the object.  2rubout-handler-options* are used as options
for the rubout handler, if 2stream* supports one; see
(rubout-handler) for more information on this.
.end_defun

.defun cli:read &optional stream (eof-errorp 3t*) eof-value recursive-p
The Common Lisp version of 3read* differs only in how its arguments
are passed.

2recursive-p* should be non-3nil* when calling from the reader or
from the defining function of a read-macro character; that is, when
reading a subexpression as part of the task of reading a larger
expression.  This has two effects: the subexpression is allowed to share
7#2n*#* labels with the containing expression, and whitespace which
terminates the subexpression (if it is a symbol or number) is not
discarded.
.end_defun

.defun read-or-end &optional stream eof-option rubout-handler-options
Like 3read*, but on an interactive stream if the input is just
the character 3End* it returns the two values 3nil* and 3:end*.
.end_defun

.defvar read-preserve-delimiters
Certain printed representations given to 3read*, notably those of symbols
and numbers, require a delimiting character after them.  (Lists do not, because
the matching close-parenthesis serves to mark the end of the list.)
Normally 3read* throws away the delimiting character if it is whitespace,
but preserves it (using the 3:untyi* stream operation) if the character is
syntactically meaningful, since it may be the start of the next expression.

If 3read-preserve-delimiters* is bound to 3t* around a call to 3read*,
the delimiting character is never thrown away, even if it is whitespace.
This may be useful for certain reader macros or special syntaxes.
.end_defvar

.defun read-preserving-whitespace &optional stream (eof-errorp 3t*) eof-value recursive-p
Like 3cli:read* but binds 3read-preserve-delimiters* to 3t*.
This is the Common Lisp way of requesting the 3read-preserve-delimiters* feature.
.end_defun

.defun read-delimited-list char &optional stream recursive-p
Reads expressions from 2stream* until the character 2char* is seen
at top level when an expression is expected; then returns a list of
the objects read.  2char* may be a fixnum or a character object.
For example, if 2char* is 7#/]*, and the text to be read from
2stream* is 3a (b c)]* ...  then the objects 3a* and 3(b c)*
are read, the 3]* is seen as a terminator and discarded, and the
value returned is 3(a (b c))*.  2recursive-p* is as for
3cli:read*.  End of file within this function is always an error
since it is always ``within an object''--the object whose textual
representation is terminated by 2char*.

Note that use of this function does not cause 2char* to terminate
tokens.  Usually you want that to happen, but it is purely under the
control of the readtable.  So you must modify the readtable to make this
so.  The usual way is to define 2char* as a macro character whose
defining function just signals an error.  The defining function is not
called when 2char* is encountered in the expected context by
3read-delimited-list*; if 2char* is encountered anywhere else,
it is an unbalanced bracket and an error is appropriate.
.end_defun

.defun read-for-top-level &optional stream eof-option
This is a slightly different version of 3read*.  It differs from 3read*
only in that it ignores close-parentheses seen at top level,
and it returns the symbol 3si:eof* if the stream reaches end-of-file
if you have not supplied an 2eof-option* (instead of signalling
an error as 3read* would).  This version of 3read* is used in
the system's ``read-eval-print'' loops.
.end_defun

.defun read-check-indentation &optional stream eof-option
This is like 3read*, but validates the input based on indentation.
It assumes that the input data is formatted to follow the usual
convention for source files, that an open-parenthesis in column zero
indicates a top-level list (with certain specific exceptions).
An open-parenthesis in column zero encountered in the middle of a list
is more likely to result from close-parentheses missing before it than
from a mistake in indentation.

If 3read-check-indentation* finds an open-parenthesis
following a return character in the middle of a list, it
invents enough close-parentheses to close off all pending lists, and
returns.  The offending open-parenthesis is 3:untyi*'d so it can begin
the next list, as it probably should.  End of file in the middle of a
list is handled likewise.

3read-check-indentation* notifies the caller of the incorrect formatting
by signaling the condition 3sys:missing-closeparen*.  This
is how the compiler is able to record a warning about the missing
parentheses.  If a condition handler proceeds, 3read* goes ahead
and invents close-parentheses.

There are a few special forms that are customarily used around function
definitions--for example, 3eval-when*, 3local-declare*, and 3comment*.
Since it is desirable to begin the function definitions in
column zero anyway, 3read-check-indentation* allows a list to begin
in column zero within one of these special forms.  A non-3nil*
3si:may-surround-defun* property identifies the symbols for which this
is allowed.
.end_defun

.defvar read-check-indentation
This variable is non-3nil* during a read in which indentation is being
checked.
.end_defvar

.subsection Non-Stream Parsing Functions

The following functions do expression input but get the characters
from a string or a list instead of a stream.

.defun read-from-string string &optional eof-option (start 30*) end
The characters of 2string* are given successively
to the reader, and the Lisp object built by the reader is returned.
Macro characters and so on all take effect.  If 2string*
has a fill-pointer it controls how much can be read.

2eof-option* is what to return if the end of the string is reached, as
in 3read*.  2start* is the index in the string of the first
character to be read.  2end* is the index at which to stop reading;
that point is treated as end of file.

3read-from-string* returns two values; the first is the object read
and the second is the index of the first character in the string not read.
If the entire string was read, this is the length of the string.

.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(read-from-string "(a b c)") => (a b c) 1and* 7
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun cli:read-from-string string &optional (eof-errorp 3t*) eof-value &key (start 30*) end preserve-whitespace
The Common Lisp version of 3read-from-string* uses a different calling
convention.  The arguments mean the same thing but are arranged
differently.  There are three arguments with no counterparts:
2eof-errorp* and 2eof-value*, which are simply passed on to
3cli:read*, and 2preserve-whitespace*, which if non-3nil* means
that the reading is done with 3read-preserve-delimiters* bound to
3t*.
.end_defun

See also the 3with-input-from-string* special form ((with-input-from-string-fun)).

.defun parse-integer string &key (start 30*) end (radix 310.*) junk-allowed
Parses the contents of 2string* (or the portion from 2start* to 2end*) as a numeral
for an integer using the specified radix, and returns the integer.
Radices larger than ten are allowed, and they use letters as digits beyond 9.
Leading whitespace is always allowed and ignored.  A leading sign is also allowed
and considered part of the number.

When 2junk-allowed* is 3nil*, the entire specified portion of string
must consist of an integer and leading and trailing whitespace.
Otherwise, an error happens.

If 2junk-allowed* is non-3nil*, parsing just stops when a non-digit
is encountered.  The number parsed so far is returned as the first
value, and the index in 2string* at which parsing stopped is returned
as the second value.  This number equals 2end* (or the length of
2string*) if there is nothing but a number.  If non-digits are found
without finding a number first, the first value is 3nil*.  Examples:
.lisp
(parse-integer " 1A " :radix 16.) => 26.
(parse-integer " 15X " :end 3) => 15.
(parse-integer " -15X " :junk-allowed t) => -15. 3
(parse-integer " 15X ") => error!
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun readlist char-list
This function is provided mainly for Maclisp compatibility.
2char-list* is a list of characters.  The characters may be
represented by anything that the function 3character* accepts:
character objects, fixnums, strings, or symbols.  The characters are
given successively to the reader, and the Lisp object built by the
reader is returned.  Macro characters and so on all take effect.

If there are more characters in 2char-list* beyond those needed to
define an object, the extra characters are ignored.  If there are not
enough characters, some kind of 3sys:read-end-of-file* error is signaled.
.end_defun

.subsection Input Error Conditions

.defcondition sys:read-error (3sys:parse-error* 3error*)
This condition name classifies all errors detected by the reader per se.
Since 3sys:parse-error* is implied, all 3sys:read-error* errors
must provide the proceed type 3:no-action* so that automatic proceed
is possible if the error happens during compilation.  See (sys:parse-error-condition).

Since this condition name implies 3sys:parse-error* and 3error*, those
two are not mentioned as implications below when 3sys:read-error* is.
.end_defcondition

.defcondition sys:read-end-of-file (3sys:read-error* 3sys:end-of-file*)
Whenever the reader signals an error for end of file, the condition object
possesses this condition name.

Since 3sys:end-of-file* is implied, the 3:stream* operation on the
condition instance returns the stream on which end of file was reached.
.end_defcondition

.defcondition sys:read-list-end-of-file (3sys:read-end-of-file* 3sys:read-error* 3sys:end-of-file*)
This condition is signaled when 3read* detects end of file in the middle of a list.

In addition to the 3:stream* operation provided because
3sys:end-of-file* is one of the proceed types, the condition instance
supports the 3:list* operation, which returns the list read so far.

Proceed type 3:no-action* is provided.  If it is used, the reader
invents a close-parenthesis to close off the list.
Within 3read-check-indentation*, the reader signals the error only once,
no matter how many levels of list are unterminated.
.end_defcondition

.defcondition sys:read-string-end-of-file (3sys:read-end-of-file* 3sys:read-error* 3sys:end-of-file*)
This is signaled when 3read* detects end of file in the middle of a
string delimited by double-quotes.

The 3:string* operation on the condition instance returns the string
read so far.

Proceed type 3:no-action* terminates the string and returns.
If the string is within other constructs that are unterminated,
another end of file error is will be signaled later.
.end_defcondition

.defcondition sys:read-symbol-end-of-file (3sys:read-end-of-file* 3sys:read-error* 3sys:end-of-file*)
This is signaled when 3read* detects end of file within
a multiple escape construct.

The 3:string* operation on the condition instance returns the print
name read so far.

Proceed type 3:no-action* terminates the symbol and returns.
If the symbol is within other constructs that are unterminated,
another end of file error is will be signaled later.
.end_defcondition

.defcondition sys:missing-closeparen (3condition*)
This condition, which is not an error, is signaled when
3read-check-indentation* finds an open-parenthesis in column zero
within a list.

Proceed type 3:no-action* is provided.  On proceeding, the reader
invents enough close-parentheses to close off all the lists that are
pending.
.end_defcondition

.section The Readtable
.setq readtable section-page
.cindex readtable

The syntax used by the reader is controlled by a data structure called
the 2readtable*.  (Some aspects of printing are also controlled by the
readtable.)  There can be many readtables, but the one that is used is
the one which is the value of 3*readtable**.  A particular syntax can be
selected for use by setting or binding 3*readtable** to a readtable
which specifies that syntax before reading or printing.  In particular,
this is how Common Lisp or traditional syntax is selected.  The
readtable also controls the symbol substitutions which implement
the distinction between the traditional and Common Lisp versions of
functions such as 3subst*, 3member*and 3defstruct*.

The functions in this section allow you to modify the syntax of
individual characters in a readtable in limited ways.  You can
also copy a readtable; then you can modify one copy and leave
the other unchanged.

A readtables may have one or more names.  Named readtables are
recorded in a central data base so that you can find a readtable by
name.  When you copy a readtable, the new one is anonymous and is not
recorded in the data base.

.defvar readtable
.defvar1 *readtable*
The value of 3readtable* or 3*readtable** is the current readtable.
This starts out as the initial standard readtable.  You can bind this
variable to change temporarily the readtable being used.

The two names are synonymous.
.end_defvar

.defconst si:standard-readtable
This is copied into 3*readtable** every time the machine is booted.
Therefore, it is normally the same as 3*readtable** unless you make
3*readtable** be some other readtable.  If you alter the contents of
3*readtable** without setting or binding it to some other readtable,
this readtable is changed.
.end_defconst

.defconst si:initial-readtable
The value of 3si:initial-readtable* is a read-only copy of the default
current readtable.  Its purpose is to preserve a copy of the standard
read syntax in case you modify the contents of 3*readtable** and regret
it later.  You could use 3si:initial-readtable* as the
2from-readtable* argument to 3copy-readtable* or
3set-syntax-from-char* to restore all or part of the standard syntax.
.end_defconst

.defconst si:common-lisp-readtable
A readtable which initially is set up to define Common Lisp read syntax.
Reading of Common Lisp programs is done using this readtable.
.end_defconst

.defconst si:initial-common-lisp-readtable
A read-only copy of 3si:common-lisp-readtable*, whose purpose is to
preserve a copy of the standard Common Lisp syntax in case you modify
3si:common-lisp-readtable* (such as, by reading a Common Lisp program
which modifies the current readtable).
.end_defconst

.defun si:rdtbl-names readtable
Returns the list of names of 3readtable*.
You may 3setf* this to add or remove names.
.end_defun

.defun si:find-readtable-named name
Returns the readtable named 3name*, or 3nil* if none is recorded.
.end_defun

.defun readtablep object
3t* if 2object* is a readtable.
.end_defun

The user can program the reader by changing the readtable in any of three ways.
The syntax of a character can be set to one of several predefined possibilities.
A character can be made into a 2macro character*, whose interpretation
is controlled by a user-supplied function which is called when the character is read.
The user can create a completely new readtable, using the readtable compiler
(3SYS: IO; RTC LISP*) to define new kinds of syntax and to assign syntax classes to
characters.  Use of the readtable compiler is not documented here.

.defun copy-readtable &optional from-readtable to-readtable
2from-readtable*, which defaults to the current readtable, is copied.
If 2from-readtable* is 3nil*, the standard Common Lisp syntax is
copied.  If 2to-readtable* is unsupplied or 3nil*, a fresh copy is
made.  Otherwise 2to-readtable* is clobbered with the copied syntax.

Use 3copy-readtable* to get a private readtable before using the following
functions to change the syntax of characters in it.  The value of 3*readtable**
at the start of a Lisp Machine session is the initial standard readtable, which
usually should not be modified.
.end_defun

.defun set-syntax-from-char to-char from-char &optional to-readtable from-readtable
Copies the syntax of 2from-char* in 2from-readtable* to character
2to-char* in 2to-readtable*.  2to-readtable* defaults to the
current readtable and 2from-readtable* defaults to 3si:initial-standard-readtable*
(standard traditional syntax).
.end_defun

.defun cli:set-syntax-from-char to-char from-char &optional to-readtable from-readtable
Is a Common Lisp function which copies the syntax of 2from-char* in
2from-readtable* to character 2to-char* in 2to-readtable*.
2to-readtable* defaults to the current readtable and
2from-readtable* defaults to 3si:initial-common-lisp-readtable*
(standard Common Lisp syntax).

Common Lisp has a peculiar idea of what it means to copy the syntax of a character.
The only aspect of syntax that the readtable supposedly specifies is the choice among
.table 7 0 300
.item *
token constituent:
digits, letters, random things like 3@*, 3!*, 3$*, and also colon!
.item *
whitespace:
spaces, 3Tab*, 3Return*.
.item *
single escape character:
3/* traditionally, 3\* in Common Lisp.
.item *
multiple escape character:
vertical-bar.
.item *
macro character:
standardly 3()",.'`;*
.item *
nonterminating macro character:
3#* is the only such character standardly defined.
.end_table

The differences among macro characters are determined entirely by the
functions that they invoke.  The differences among token constituents
(including the difference between 3A* and colon) are fixed!  You
can make 3A* be a macro character, or whitespace, or a quote
character, but if you make it a token constituent then it always behaves
the way it normally does.  You can make colon be a macro character,
or whitespace, etc., but if it is a token constituent it always
delimits package names.  If you make open-parenthesis into a token
constituent, there is only one kind of token constituent it can be (it
forces the token to be a symbol, like 3$* or 3@* or 3%*).

This is not how Lisp Machine readtables really work, but since
3cli:set-syntax-from-char* is provided just for Common Lisp, the
behavior specified by Common Lisp is laboriously provided.  So, if
2from-char* is some kind of token constituent, this function makes
2to-char* into a token constituent of the kind that 2to-char* is
supposed to be--not the kind of token constituent that 2from-char* is.

By contrast, the non-Common-Lisp 3set-syntax-from-char* would make
2to-char* have exactly the same syntactic properties that
2from-char* has.
.end_defun

.defun set-character-translation from-char to-char &optional readtable
Changes 2readtable* so that 2from-char* will be translated to 2to-char* upon
read-in, when 2readtable* is the current readtable.
This is normally used only for translating lower case letters to upper case.
Character translation is inhibited by escape characters and within strings.
2readtable* defaults to the current readtable.
.end_defun

.need 1800
.nopara
The following syntax-setting functions are more or less obsolete.

.defun set-syntax-from-description char description &optional readtable
Sets the syntax of 2char* in 2readtable* to be that described by the
symbol 2description*.  2readtable* defaults to the current readtable.

Each readtable has its own set of descriptions which it defines.
The following descriptions are defined in the standard readtable:
.table 3 0 1500
.item si:alphabetic
An ordinary character such as `3A*'.
.item si:break
A token separator such as `3(*'.  (Obviously left parenthesis has other
properties besides being a break.
.item si:whitespace
A token separator that can be ignored, such as `3 *'.
.item si:single
'cindex single-character symbol
A self-delimiting single-character symbol.  The initial readtable does not
contain any of these.
.item si:escape
The character quoter.  In the initial readtable this is `3/*'.
.item si:multiple-escape
The symbol print-name quoter.  In the initial readtable this is `3|*'.
.item si:macro
A macro character.  Don't use this; use 3set-macro-character* ((set-macro-character-fun)).
.item si:non-terminating-macro
A macro character recognized only at the start of a token.  In the
initial readtable, `7#*' is such a character.  (It is also a dispatching
macro, but that is another matter.) The correct way to make a character
be a macro is with 3set-macro-character*.
.item si:character-code-escape
The octal escape for special characters.  In the initial readtable this is `3*'.
.item si:digitscale
a character for shifting an integer by digits.
In the initial readtable this is `7^*'.
.item si:bitscale
A character for shifting an integer by bits.
In the initial readtable this is `7_*' (underscore).

.item si:slash
.item1 si:circlecross
Obsolete synonyms for 3si:escape* and 3si:character-code-escape*.
.end_table

Unfortunately it is no longer possible to provide 3si:doublequote* as
double-quote is now an ordinary macro character.

These symbols may be moved to the keyword package at some point.
.end_defun

.defun setsyntax character arg2 arg3
This exists only for Maclisp compatibility.  The above functions are preferred in new
programs.  The syntax of 2character* is altered in the current readtable, according
to 2arg2* and 2arg3*.  2character* can be a fixnum, a symbol, or a string,
i.e. anything acceptable to the 3character* function.
2arg2* is usually a keyword; it can be in any package since this is a Maclisp
compatibility function.  The following values are allowed for 2arg2*:
.table 3
.kitem :macro
The character becomes a macro character.  2arg3* is the name of a function to be
invoked when this character is read.  The function takes no arguments, may 3tyi* or
3read* from 3*standard-input** (i.e. may call 3tyi* or 3read* without
specifying a stream),
and returns an object which is taken as the result of the read.

.kitem :splicing
Like 3:macro* but the object returned by the macro function is a list
that is 3nconc*ed into the list being read.  If the character is read
anywhere except inside a list (at top level or after a dotted-pair dot),
then it may return 3()*, which means it is ignored, or 3(2obj*)*,
which means that 2obj* is read.

.kitem :single
The character becomes a self-delimiting single-character symbol.  If 2arg3* is
a fixnum, the character is translated to that character.

.item nil
The syntax of the character is not changed, but if 2arg3* is
a fixnum, the character is translated to that character.

.item 1a symbol*
The syntax of the character is changed to be the same as that of
the character 2arg2* in the standard initial readtable.  2arg2*
is converted to a character by taking the first character of its print name.
Also if 2arg3* is
a fixnum, the character is translated to that character.
.end_table
.end_defun

.section Read-Macro Characters
.cindex read macro characters
.cindex macro characters

A 2read-macro character* (or just 2macro character*) is a character
whose syntax is defined by a function which the reader calls whenever
that character is seen (unless it is escaped).  This function can
optionally read additional characters and is then responsible for
returning the object which they represent.

The standard meanings of the characters open-parenthesis, semicolon,
single-quote, double-quote, 3#*, backquote (3`*) and comma are
implemented by making them macro characters.

For example, open-parenthesis is implemented as a macro character
whose defining function reads expressions until a close-parenthesis is found,
throws away the close-parenthesis, and returns a list of the expressions read.
(It actually must be more complicated than this in order to deal properly
with dotted lists and with indentation checking.)  Semicolon is implemented as
a macro character whose defining function swallows characters until a 3Return*
and then returns no values.

Close-parenthesis and close-horseshoe (7*) are also macro
characters so that they will terminate symbols.  Their defining
functions signal errors if actually called; but when these delimiters
are encountered in their legitimate contexts they are recognized
and handled specially before the defining function is called.

The user can also define macro characters.

When a macro's defining function is called, it receives two arguments:
the input stream, and the macro character being handled.  The function
may read characters from the stream, and should return zero or more
values, which are the objects that the macro construct ``reads as''.  Zero
values causes the macro construct to be ignored (the semicolon macro
character does this), and one value causes the macro construct to
read as a single object (most macro characters do this).  More than one
value is allowed only within a list.

.cindex terminating macro character
.cindex non-terminating macro character
Macro characters may be 2terminating* or 2non-terminating*.
A non-terminating macro character is only recognized as a macro character
when it appears at the beginning of a token.  If it appears when a token
is already in progress, it is treated as a symbol constituent.  Of the standard
macro characters, all but 3#* are terminating.

.cindex dispatch macro character
One kind of macro character is the 2dispatch* macro character.
This kind of character is handled by reading one more character,
converting it to upper case,
and looking it up in a table.  Thus, the dispatch macro character
is the start of a two-character sequence, with which is associated
a defining function.  3#* is the only standardly defined dispatch
macro character.

When a dispatch macro character is used, it may be followed by a decimal
integer which serves as a parameter.  The character for the dispatch
is actually the first non-digit seen.

The defining function for a dispatch macro two-character sequence
is almost like that of an ordinary macro character.  However, it receives
one more argument.  This is the parameter, the decimal integer that
followed the dispatch macro character, or 3nil* if no parameter was written.
Also, the second argument is the subdispatch character, the second character
of the sequence.  The dispatch macro character itself is not available.

.defun set-macro-character char function &optional non-terminating-p in-readtable
Sets the syntax of character 2char* in readtable 2in-readtable* to be that of a
macro character which is handled by 2function*.  When that character is read
by 3read*, 2function* is called.

2char* is made a non-terminating macro character
if 2non-terminating-p* is non-3nil*, a terminating one otherwise.
.end_defun

.defun get-macro-character char in-readtable
Returns two values that describe the macro character status of 2char*
in 2in-readtable*.  If 2char* is not a macro character, both values
are 3nil*.  Otherwise, the first value is the 2function* and the
second value is the 2non-terminating-p* for this character.

Those two values, passed to 3set-macro-character*, are usually
sufficient to recreate exactly the syntax 2char* has now;
however, since one of the arguments that the function receives
is the macro character that invoked it, it may not behave the same
if installed on a different character or in a different readtable.
In particular, the definition of a dispatch macro character is
a standard function that looks the macro character up in the readtable.
Thus, the definition only records that the macro character 2is*
a dispatch macro character; it does not say what subcharacters
are allowed or what they mean.
.end_defun

.defun make-dispatch-macro-character char &optional non-terminating-p in-readtable
Makes 2char* be a dispatch macro character in 2in-readtable*.  This
means that when 2char* is seen 3read* will read one more character
to decide what to do.  3#* is an example of a dispatch macro
character.  2non-terminating-p* means the same thing as in
3set-macro-character*.
.end_defun

.defun set-dispatch-macro-character char subchar function &optional in-readtable
Sets the syntax of the two-character sequence 2char* 2subchar*, assuming that
2char* is already a dispatch macro character.  2function* becomes the
defining function for this sequence.

If 2subchar* is lower case, it is converted to upper case.  Case is never
significant for the character that follows a dispatch macro character.
The decimal digits may not be defined as subchars since they are always
used for infix numeric arguments as in 7#5r*.
.end_defun

.defun get-dispatch-macro-character char subchar &optional in-readtable
Returns the 2function* for 2subchar* following dispatch macro character 2char*
in readtable 2in-readtable*.  The value is 3nil* if 2subchar* is not defined
for following 2char*.

These subroutines are for use by the defining functions of macro characters.
Ordinary 3read* should not be used for reading subexpressions, and
the ordinary 3:tyi* operation or functions 3read-char* or 3tyi*
should not be used for single-character input.  The functions below
should be used instead.

.defun si:read-recursive &optional stream
Equivalent to 3(cli:read 2stream* t nil t)*.  See (cli:read-fun).
This is the recommended way for a macro character's defining function
to read a subexpression.
.end_defun

.defun si:xr-xrtyi stream ignore-whitespace no-chars-special no-multiple-escapes
Reads the next input character from 2stream*, for a macro character's defining
function.  If 2ignore-whitespace* is non-3nil*, any whitespace characters
seen are discarded and the first non-whitespace character is returned.

The first value is the character as translated; the third value is the
original character, before translation.  The second value is a syntax
code which is of no interest to users except to be passed to
3si:xr-xruntyi* if this character must be unread.

Normally, this function processes all the escape characters, and
performs translations (such as from lower case letters to upper case
letters) on characters not escaped.  Font specifiers (epsilons followed
by digits or 7**) are ignored if the file is formatted using them.

If 2no-multiple-escapes* is non-3nil*, multiple escapes (vertical bar
characters) are not processed; they are returned to the caller.  This mode
is used for reading the contents of strings.  If 2no-chars-special*
is non-3nil*, no escape characters are processed.  All characters are
simply returned to the caller (except that font specifiers are still
discarded if appropriate).
.end_defun

.defun si:xr-xruntyi stream char num
Unreads 2char*, for a macro character's defining function.
2char* should be the third value returned by the last call to 3si:xr-xrtyi*,
and 2num* should be the second value.
.end_defun

.defvar *read-suppress*
If this variable is non-3nil*, all the standard read functions and
macro characters do their best to avoid any errors, and any side effects
except for removing characters from the input stream.  For example,
symbols are not interned to avoid either errors (for nonexistent packages)
or side effects (adding new symbols to packages).  In fact, 3nil* is
used in place of any symbol that is written.

User macro characters should also notice this variable when appropriate.

The purpose of the variable is to allow expressions to be skipped and
discarded.  The read-time conditional constructs 7#+* and 7#-* bind
it to 3t* to skip the following expression if it is not wanted.
.end_defvar

The following functions for defining macro characters are more or less obsolete.

.defun set-syntax-macro-char char function &optional readtable
Changes 2readtable* so that 2char* is a macro character.  When
2char* is read, 2function* is called.  2readtable* defaults to the
current readtable.

2function* is called with two arguments, 2list-so-far* and the input stream.
When a list is being read, 2list-so-far* is that list (3nil* if this is the
first element).  At the top level of 3read*, 2list-so-far* is the symbol
3:toplevel*.  After a dotted-pair dot, 2list-so-far* is the symbol 3:after-dot*.
2function* may read any number of characters from the input stream and process
them however it likes.

2function* should return three values, called 2thing*, 2type*, and 2splice-p*.
2thing* is the object read.  If 2splice-p* is 3nil*, 2thing* is the result.
If 2splice-p* is non-3nil*, then when reading a list 2thing* replaces
the list being read--often it will be 2list-so-far* with something else 
3nconc*'ed onto the end.  At top-level and after a dot, if 2splice-p* is non-3nil*
the 2thing* is ignored and the macro-character does not contribute anything to
the result of 3read*.
2type* is a historical artifact and is not really used; 3nil* is a safe value.
Most macro character functions return just one value and let the other two
default to 3nil*.

Note that the convention for values returned by 2function* is different from that
used for functions specified in 3set-macro-character*, above.  3set-syntax-macro-char*
works by encapsulating 2function* in a closure to convert the values to
the sort that 3set-macro-character* wants and then passing the closure to
3set-macro-character*.

2function* should not have any side-effects other than on the stream and 2list-so-far*.
Because of the way the rubout-handler works, 2function* can be called several times
during the reading of a single expression in which the macro character only appears once.

2char* is given the same syntax that single-quote, backquote, and comma have
in the initial readtable (it is called 3:macro* syntax).
.end_defun

.defun set-syntax-#-macro-char char function &optional readtable
Causes 2function* to be called when 7#2char** is read.
2readtable* defaults to the current readtable.
The function's arguments and return values are the same as for normal macro
characters, documented above.  When 2function* is called, the special variable
3si:xr-sharp-argument* contains 3nil* or a number that is the
number or special bits between the 3#* and 2char*.
.end_defun

.defun setsyntax-sharp-macro character type function &optional readtable
This exists only for Maclisp compatibility.  3set-dispatch-macro-character*
should be used instead.
If 2function* is 3nil*, 7#2character** is turned off, otherwise it
becomes a macro that calls 2function*.  2type* can be 3:macro*, 3:peek-macro*,
3:splicing*, or 3:peek-splicing*.  The splicing part controls whether 2function* returns
a single object or a list of objects.  Specifying peek causes 2character*
to remain in the input stream when 2function* is called; this is useful if
2character* is something like a left parenthesis.  2function* gets one
argument, which is 3nil* or the number between the 3#* and the 2character*.

.section The :read and :print Stream Operations

A stream can specially handle the reading and printing of objects by
handling the 3:read* and 3:print* stream operations.  Note that these
operations are optional and most streams do not support them.

If the 3read* function is given a stream that has 3:read* in its
which-operations, then instead of reading in the normal way it sends the
3:read* message to the stream with one argument, 3read*'s
2eof-option* if it had one or a magic internal marker if it didn't.
Whatever the stream returns is what 3read* returns.
If the stream wants to implement the 3:read* operation by internally
calling 3read*, it must use a different stream that does not have
3:read* in its which-operations.

If a stream has 3:print* in its which-operations, it may intercept all
object printing operations, including those due to the 3print*, 3prin1*,
and 3princ* functions, those due to 3format*, and those used internally,
for instance in printing the elements of a list.  The stream receives the
3:print* message with three arguments: the object being printed, the
2depth* (for comparison against the 3*print-level** variable), and
2escape-p* (which is the value of 3*print-escape**).  If the stream
returns 3nil*, then normal printing takes place as usual.  If the stream
returns non-3nil*, then 3print* does nothing; the stream is assumed to have
output an appropriate printed representation for the object.
The two following functions are useful in this connection; however, they are
in the 3system-internals* package and may be changed without much notice.

.defun si:print-object object depth stream &optional which-operations
Outputs the printed-representation of 2object* to 2stream*, as modified
by 2depth* and the values of the 3*print-...* variables.

This is the internal guts of the Lisp printer.  When a stream's
3:print* handler calls this function, it should supply the list
3(:string-out)* for 2which-operations*, to prevent itself from being
called recursively.  Or it can supply 3nil* if it does not want to
receive 3:string-out* messages.

If you want to customize the behavior of all printing of Lisp objects,
advising (see (advise)) this function is the way to do it.  See
(customizing-the-printer).
.end_defun

.defun si:print-list list depth stream which-operations
This is the part of the Lisp printer that prints lists.  A stream's
3:print* handler can call this function, passing along its own arguments
and its own which-operations, to arrange for a list to be printed the
normal way and the stream's 3:print* hook to get a chance at each of the
list's elements.
