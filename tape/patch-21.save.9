  (1 "In v20, Tar-Format had wrong nickname; should be \"TAR\", not \"TAR-FORMAT\".
Delete old name from *tape-format-alist* if present
(e.g. through reloading)." "keith" NIL)
  (2 "Another fix to TAPE:SELECT-FORMAT.  Again, use (cdr(RASS...)) to compare
flavor names in *TAPE-FORMAT-ALIST*.  This time, fix the case that
SELECT-FORMAT gets called with a flavor name.  

This is Part 1 of fix to bug with right-click on selected format in Tape
Frame." "keith" NIL)
  (3 "Even better fix to SELECT-FORMAT.  Surely it meant to call :SET-OPTIONS
unless INIT-OPTIONS were provided." "keith" NIL)
  (4 "Part 2 of fix to 'selected format' on tape frame.

Right click calls PROCESS-FORMAT-SELECT, which was finding out the
default tape format, but not doing anything with it.  Call SELECT-FORMAT
on the default format, or failing that, on the first one on the alist." "keith" NIL)
