  (2 "Improve error notifications.

CHECK-FOR-ERROR accepts :ERROR-TRACE argument, something to print if a
tape error occurs and the trace variable TM:*NOTIFY-ON-ERRORS* is
non-NIL.  Also add this argument wherever CHECK-FOR-ERROR is called." "keith" NIL 2799849906)
  (3 "LMFL tape format file property lists were being written and read using
whatever readtable happened to be bound at the moment.  This could cause
READ-FROM-STRING errors. Fix is:

1) In :READ-FILE-HEADER, to win at reading tape plists written in the
past, try ZL and then CL readtables (if a read error occurs).  If we
still get a read error, say so before printing the error.

2) Always, from now on, write the plist in \"standard\" (ZL)
format.  This is best for downward-compatibility." "keith" NIL 2799852653)
