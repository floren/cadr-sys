  (2 "Improve error notifications.

CHECK-FOR-ERROR accepts :ERROR-TRACE argument, something to print if a
tape error occurs and the trace variable TM:*NOTIFY-ON-ERRORS* is
non-NIL.  Also add this argument wherever CHECK-FOR-ERROR is called." "keith" NIL 2799849906)
  (3 "LMFL tape format file property lists were being written and read using
whatever readtable happened to be bound at the moment.  This could cause
READ-FROM-STRING errors. Fix is:

1) In :READ-FILE-HEADER, to win at reading tape plists written in the
past, try ZL and then CL readtables (if a read error occurs).  If we
still get a read error, say so before printing the error.

2) Always, from now on, write the plist in \"standard\" (ZL)
format.  This is best for downward-compatibility." "keith" NIL 2799852653)
  (4 "  This should solve the problem that's been plaguing our backups.
  
  Sometimes the last file written on the tape is finished with one EOF, but
  the next file fails to fit, and the double EOF is (for unknown reasons) not
  being written to indicate logical EOT.  On a new tape, the remainder of the
  tape appears to be blank, which you find out next time you try to verify or
  restore the tape.  On COMPARE-FILES during a backup, this blows out the
  entire backup.  I added error handling for that case, but not
  RESTORE-FILES, because the integrity of a restoration is not affected." "keith" NIL 2799872582)
