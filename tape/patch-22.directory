to be evaluated.  Add :falcon to eliminate warning message on warm boot." "pld" NIL)
  (2 "Fix error-reporting problems with tape comparison functions.
1. make sure all flavors of comparison errors can handle :source-file method.
2. fix up error :report method messages
3. where tape s/w was constructing error message by sending :source-file message to
condition instance, use :report method instead" "keith" NIL)

of a tape format." "keith" NIL)
