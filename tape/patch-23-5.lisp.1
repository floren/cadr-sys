;;; Patch file for Tape version 23.5
;;; Reason:
;;;  Tapemaster device doesn't seem to do search-multiple-filemarks in
;;;  reverse direction when at end of tape -- leaves you at end of tape.
;;; Written 1-Jun-88 15:51:11 by pld (Peter L. DeWolf) at site Gigamos Cambridge
;;; while running on Azathoth from band 2
;;; with Experimental System 124.15, Experimental Local-File 74.0, Experimental File-Server 23.1, Experimental Unix-Interface 12.0, Experimental ZMail 72.0, Experimental Tape 23.4, Experimental Lambda-Diag 16.0, microcode 1756, SDU Boot Tape 3.14, SDU ROM 8.
