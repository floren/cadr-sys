  (1 "Improvements to interface of PARTITION-SEARCHER.

1. When it drags someone into the command loop against their will (maybe
they mis-typed an argument), give them a message that orients them.

2. Print help note on first entering command loop.  Same after every 8
bogus keystrokes (they're obviously confused).

3. Print more complete info on current selections.

4. If they have sufficiently specified a partition to select, give them
a message telling them how to exit." "keith" NIL)
