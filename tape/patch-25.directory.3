  (1 "Fix problem that could mess up a backup; if the problem occurred on the
Nth tape, user had to redo N tapes.

When we get physical EOT (end-of-tape) while writing files, we attempt
to reverse position to beginning of last file and mark logical EOT.  If
we get another EOT error here (not while finishing the tape, but while
reversing position and spacking forward), there isn't room for logical
EOT, but the tape is still good!  User might get a warning when
restoring from this tape that physical EOT was encountered." "fileserver" NIL 2797604334)
