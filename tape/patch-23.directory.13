Specifically, say \"listing 1 file\" not \"1 files\".

  (3 "It appears that TI tapes store some unusual file properties:  :host :directory
:device :name :type :version.  The tape system has code to filter these out,
but apparently an older version didn't and we have some files on disk with
those properties.  We should filter them out when we write tapes to avoid
a silly warning when reading the tape again...." "pld" NIL)

the middle button to specify a number of files to skip." "pld" NIL)

reverse direction when at end of tape -- leaves you at end of tape." "pld" NIL)
